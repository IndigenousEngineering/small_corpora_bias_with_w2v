If it ends up happening, the proposed change in the way we treat basis (by adjusting it for inflation, see proposed changes [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2018/07/31/new-tax-break-trump-administration-considers-indexing-capital-tax-for-inflation/)) **could cause a person who owns hundreds of millions of dollars of appreciated real estate, purchased before 1983, in a state with high income taxes, to go from being insolvent to being very much in the green.** This profile sounds suspiciously like our dear President. 

I threw this hypothesis out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5dop3y/comment/da65hkw/) when Trump refused to divest his holdings, because it is a possible explanation for him being **unable** to liquidate his holdings. It's entirely possible that he has had his cabinet working on finding a way out of this hole his entire presidency, and they just now came across the ludicrous idea to change basis treatment as a solution.

The problem for Trump: it's possible that for his real estate, in particular, he would be hit with a higher tax bill than any profit he would make (the tax bill + the debt repayment would be more than the sale price), and I doubt he actually has the liquid assets to pay the taxes. That's what happens when you get to ""negative basis."" He'd have to die holding those properties (or change the tax laws in his favor).

**\*\*For anyone that actually cares to dig into the details, here's some free education on tax law!****

**\*\*UNDER CURRENT LAW**** 

(1) Taxpayer buys an office building in 1983 for $10,000,000 (assume for purposes of this example, the entire purchase price is properly allocated to the office building, which is depreciable). Over the next 30 years, the property appreciates in value, the taxpayer fully depreciates the original basis of $10 million in the building to zero, borrows against the property, and takes the loaned funds tax free. As a result in 2014, the office building is now worth $20 million, has zero adjusted tax basis, and has a mortgage on the building of $15 million ($5 million of net equity in the property).

(2) Note, because the property was placed in service in 1983, an accelerated method of depreciation was allowable on the property. As such, a taxable sale of the property will be subject to recapture under the Code. Because the property was placed in service prior to 1986, recapture is under section 1245 (rather than section 1250, which generally applies to real property). As such, the total amount of the depreciation deductions is subject to recapture as ordinary income.

(3) If the building is sold for $20 million in a taxable transaction, the gain would break down as follows:

Amount Recognized: $20,000,000

Adjusted Basis: $ ------

Recapture: $10,000,000 ordinary income

Long-Term Capital Gain: $10,000,000 long-term capital gain

Assuming the taxpayer is in the highest income tax bracket and in a relatively high income tax state, like a New York City taxpayer, the ordinary rate would be approximately 45% and the long-term capital gain rate would be approximately 37%. The total tax liability would be $8.2 million. After repayment of the $15 million of debt, the taxpayer (who would net $5 million in cash from the transaction before taxes) would actually be in deficit by approximately -$3.2 million after the payment of income taxes.

(4) Compare the result if the taxpayer died owning the building (assume for simplicity’s sake, the building no longer has a mortgage). The building would get a “step-up” in basis under section 1014(a) to fair market value, the recapture and long-term capital gain tax problem would be eliminated. If the taxpayer has $5.34 million of Applicable Exclusion available, the maximum estate tax liability (assuming a top state death tax rate of 16% and state death tax exemption equal to the federal exclusion amount) is approximately $7.3 million (maximum blended rate of 49.6%). If the Applicable Exclusion Amount grows to $8 million for example, then the estate tax liability falls to a bit less than $6.0 million. If the foregoing building was in California, the income tax liability would be greater, and the estate tax cost would be even less because California does not have a death tax. With an applicable Exclusion Amount of $5.34, the estate tax liability is less than $5.9 million.\*

(5) Property placed in service after 1986 will not have as egregious of an income tax problem because the gain would not have recapture calculated under section 1245. Rather, section 1250 would be the applicable recapture provision. “Section 1250 property” means any real property, with certain exceptions that are not applicable, that is or has been property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation. Section 1250(a)(1)(A) provides that if section 1250 property is disposed of, the ""applicable percentage” of the lower of the “additional depreciation” in respect of the property or the gain realized with respect to the disposition of the property shall be treated as ordinary income. In short, section 1250 provides that all or part of any depreciation deduction in excess of straight-line depreciation is recaptured as ordinary income. Under the current depreciation system, straight-line depreciation is required for all residential rental and nonresidential real property. As such, section 1250 recapture is typically not a problem for property placed in service after 1986. The Code does, however, tax “unrecaptured section 1250 gain” at a 25% tax rate. Unrecaptured section 1250 gain is essentially the lesser of all depreciation on the property or the net gain realized (after certain losses) to the extent not treated as ordinary income under section 1250.

**\*\*UNDER PROPOSED CHANGES TO BASIS****

Chain the purchase price of the building in my above example to inflation. 

$10 million in 1983 is a little over $25 million in 2018 ($25,300,100.40). We'll keep the numbers simple and round it to $25 million.

For the purpose of this example we're going to assume that the proposed changes to basis adjustment chain the original purchase price to inflation, and not the adjusted numbers along the way, as record-keeping for that sort of thing would prove nearly impossible. 

Thus, Taxpayer buys building in 1983 for $10 million. He fully depreciates it under existing tax laws, saving money on his income taxes, over some indeterminate period of time during the next 34 years. The building appreciates to $20 million, and he borrows against the new equity, tax free. Let's use the same numbers as above. At the end of the term, the building is worth $20 million, there is an existing mortgage of $15 million, and the net equity is $5 million. Taxpayer has benefited from the use of the tax savings through depreciation and the use of the tax-free money he got by re-mortgaging the property after its appreciation. 

PLOT TWIST, the Trump administration decides, unilaterally, that the $10 million purchase price should actually have been indexed to inflation, so the purchase price is now set at $25 million.

After you deduct the correctly taken $10 million in depreciation, that leaves an adjusted basis of $15 million. With the new adjusted basis, Taxpayer can completely wipe out the $10 million of recapture liability, as well as half of the long-term capital gain liability, leaving him a tax liability of only $1.85 million. Given that the taxpayer pockets $5 million in cash from the proceeds of the transaction after paying off the debt on the property, he has $3.15 million left after paying off the long-term capital gain.

**\*\*Summary\*\* Under the proposed changes to basis, a Taxpayer that suspiciously fits the profile of Donald J. Trump goes, overnight, from having a $3.2 million LOSS on a sale of property to a $3.15 million GAIN on the same property, under the same set of facts.** This taxpayer has also already received the benefit of \~$5 million in reduced taxes through depreciation deductions along the way, as well as the use of tax free funds from new debt on the appreciated property.

Now realize that the numbers in the example are peanuts compared to the hundreds of millions in purchases Donald Trump's company made over the years and the massive appreciation in NY real estate.

\*The exclusion amount is based on 2014 numbers and ultimately doesn't matter, but the exclusion amount is now $11.18 million per person in 2018."

Fox didn't even have one camera trained on the stage throughout the entire event.  

-All Fox camera shots were on the ground and the operators only surveyed the thinner boundaries of the event to make it appear much less crowded than reality.  

-While MLK, Jr.'s granddaughter was speaking, Fox was on a commercial break. They didn't even mention it when they returned. 

-Fox was the only station cutting to commercials. All other networks provided a commercial free program.  

-Fox did not spend one solitary second covering one speech from the stage. In fact, if you only watched Fox, you would not even know there was a stage.  

-When a speaker was on, Fox editorialized ON TOP OF THE SPEAKER. Once again, if you only digested Fox news, you wouldn't have known it was a speech coming from a center stage. You would only think someone in the mob was talking on a bull horn randomly. 

Fox News is a puppet propaganda network for the ~~GOP~~ NRA  and the only way to truly appreciate this is to watch how they cover an event like this one. During the Charlottesville event, while most channels zeroed in on the vehicular assault and murder, Fox kept a video perpetually cutting to A SEPARATE EVENT IN NC showing anti-fascists pulling down a confederate statue.  

Frankly, it is utterly profound whenever adults attack children. But Fox doesn't stop at routine shamelessness. Instead, they double down and either censor or ridicule children who have been through an extreme situation that most people can't conceptualize. It's so disturbing it causes me physical discomfort. 

There is a reason Fox's headquarters in NYC is built like a fortress and their morning program is aired on the fourth floor. All the other networks feel comfortable letting spectators crowd the windows of their studio and do acts on the street with a live audience. Fox can't operate like this. They have to have 100% control over every aspect of their broadcast because the threat or protest is too much to handle.  

It's one thing to be biased in your political broadcast. Fox goes farther. Censoring children and then attacking them goes beyond anything I've ever seen in news broadcasting. These people are quite capable of anything. 

Fox News should be a high priority target for forthcoming demonstrations. "

I guess it's hard to realise how things look when you're always looking at them from one perspective. I never really put myself in the shoes of someone who was looking at the Donald from the outside in, so I never truly understood what people were talking about when they said the_donald is a hate subreddit. Now that they've chastised me for being against a nuclear strike on North Korea. I realise how dangerous the thought process and groupthink of that place is.

Here are some insider details that few people may know if it's useful at all.

#1 the_donald uses propaganda *extensively* all while complaining that anything that is against their agenda is *propaganda*. This is frightening because oppressive regimes in the past have done the exact same thing. (Nationalist Socialists workers party of Germany is an example)

#2 the_donald IS racist and they hate transsexual individuals. Constantly and consistently you will see posts in the subreddit claiming that blacks have a low IQ and that transsexuals are mentally ill. They also claim that some new scientific discovery proves the out of Africa theory wrong. They HATE the out of Africa theory.

#3 the_donald is scared to death of the Mueller investigation. They will dig up **anything** to try and justify the connection between Moscow and POTUS. Small stupid little incidents mostly involving the DNC, and trying to skew it as a ""set up"" in order to push blame away from the president. 

#4 the_donald is a strict think-tank dictatorship, meaning if you disagree slightly with what the mainstream trumpers are doing, you are immediately ridiculed and banned. I've seen hundreds of TRUMP SUPPORTERS get banned by their own people for not adhering to the think tank gestapo. 

#5 I'm almost 100% certain that the_donald uses bots to manipulate posts. I was never in the mod ""inner circle"" so I can't prove it. But for having under 500k subscribers posts get upvoted extremely quickly, I mean like 1.5k upvotes in a matter of 2 minutes.....

#6 Gay Trump supporters are routinely ignored and teased. Comments like ""yeh you support Trump good job, just keep the gay shit to yourself"" happen all the time.

In review the_donald is everything that I lied to myself telling myself that it wasn't. In the_donalds eyes the goal of the moderation team is to convince the user base that they are martyrs, and punished by Reddit for unjust causes. But in reality them being censored is the best thing that Reddit could of done. Ultimately they are a liability and their thought process is extremely dangerous. They are walking down the same path that very bad, evil oppressive regimes did. Claiming themselves to be victims and martyrs all the while feeding themselves propaganda and Censoring anyone whom disagrees with them. 

I apologise to America for being a part of that cesspool. And now that I have awoken I will do all I can to educate people on how dangerous these little groups can be."

* Trump's treason.

* The illegality of Trump's position in power.

* The resulting legal illegitimacy of Trump's appointees.

All of which are mainstream discussions you can find expounded in lectures by Harvard professors, democracy experts, international diplomats, world-renowned journalists, etc., but we are now so far through the Looking Glass of information control that Russian trolls declare them ""fringe"" and deliver fake votes in support of their trolling.

Only problem is that their ordinary trolls apparently **can't fake IP addresses.**  I posted IP-limited polls (meaning you can't vote twice from the same location) asking the simple question of whether Donald Trump is a US President.  The vote was overwhelmingly that he is NOT, but a funny thing happened in addition to that: **The posts directing people to the poll were heavily downvoted**.  Oops.

I also randomly contacted subscribers and regular contributors in some subs where this happens, and couldn't find a single one who even *disagreed* with posts that were heavily downvoted.  It's almost as if the voting had nothing to do with the votes of actual users.

Admins have been contacted about this for months.  If they do anything - which I see no evidence of - they do it days or weeks after the fact, allowing it to continue in perpetuity, uninterrupted.

Reddit is now Russian property, as are other social media platforms...as likely are the actual voting systems in large swaths of the country.  

We should not allow ourselves to be shocked if the dystopian conditions that now dominate social media are a harbinger of a much more concrete form of vote-rigging.

Do not be shocked.  Be prepared."

Hello, [Company Name].

It has come to my attention that you are still programming advertisements on Fox News, and specifically, Hannity.

I hope you are paying attention to recent Hannity broadcasts, in which Sean outwardly excuses statutory rape and minimizes sexual assault allegations against American Republican political figures.

As a result of your continued support of Hannity, I'll no longer be purchasing [product], although I have purchased [product] for years. You'll win my business, and that of countless others, when you cease advertising on such propagandist and biased platforms.

Thank you very much,

##**Trump claiming that black people are lazy, and that's their trait, full quote and source:**
>“Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”**[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/sunday/is-donald-trump-a-racist.html?_r=0)**

>""Trump eventually denied making those comments. But in 1997 in a Playboy interview, he conceded “the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.”[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/sunday/is-donald-trump-a-racist.html?_r=1)

##**And here is the direct quote by Trump about the that person's claims:**

>""Nobody has had worse things written about them than me,” Trump says. “And here I am. The stuff O'Donnell wrote about me is probably true. The guy’s a fucking loser. A fucking loser. I brought the guy in to work for me; it turns out he didn’t know that much about what he was doing. I think I met the guy two or three times total. And this guy goes off and writes a book about me, like he knows me! I understand it. He needs the money, so he uses my name to sell some books.

##**Trump falsely claiming that immigrants commit more crimes, and mexicans coming here are rapist, druggies, and criminals, to quote him:**
>""When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

>“What can be simpler or more accurately stated? The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.”

###**Here are the facts:**
>""Data on immigrants and crime are incomplete, but a range of studies show there is no evidence immigrants commit more crimes than native-born Americans. In fact, first-generation immigrants are predisposed to lower crime rates than native-born Americans. (The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for restrictive immigration laws, has a detailed report showing the shortfalls of immigrant crime data.)

>Immigration and crime levels have had inverse trajectories since the 1990s: immigration has increased, while crime has decreased. Some experts say the influx of immigrants contributed to the decrease in crime rates, by increasing the denominator while not adding significantly to the numerator.""

##**He failed to distance himself from KKK grand wizard, David Duke, on Live TV after learning that he's supporting Trump. He even claimed that he doesn't know who David Duke is:**

>""But Trump, who claims to have the ""world’s greatest memory,"" seemed to have forgotten this by Feb. 28. When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked him about Duke, Trump claimed ignorance four times:

>""Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. okay? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know.

>""I don't know, did he endorse me or what's going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. …

>""I don't know any -- honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I have ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him.""

>Founded in 2013 by a neo-Nazi named Andrew Anglin, The Daily Stormer is among the most prominent online gathering places for white nationalists and anti-Semites, with sections devoted to “The Jewish Problem” and “Race War.” Mr. Anglin, 31, explained that although he had some disagreements with him, Mr. Trump was the only candidate willing to speak the truth about Mexicans.

>“Trump is willing to say what most Americans think: It’s time to deport these people,” Mr. Anglin wrote. “He is also willing to call them out as criminal rapists, murderers and drug dealers.”

**[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/us/politics/donald-trump-white-identity.html?_r=0)**

*Let me ask you this, is endorsement by a bunch of racist pieces of shit enough to prove what the guy says and believes in makes a racist?* 

****

##**He's retweeted white supremacists, and tweeted false data that supports racist ideology:**

>""Last fall, he retweeted a graphic with fictitious crime statistics claiming that 81 percent of white homicide victims in 2015 were killed by blacks. (No such statistic was available for 2015 at the time; the actual figure for 2014 was 15 percent, according to the F.B.I.)""[Image of said tweet](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/F-Vvag7xPOFj81AxWrRYIcgWkxfI-XcskVw50Dw5lXTAYv8B5Agb3K1qcUbEFFIAsmss2-GyZCorvd0rguxRcKRLHisVxz5ISq6ZqWIBmanhvr_MW8aFzf18GKfH19h0adcE8Pvc)

###**To quote politifact:**
>""None of the numbers are supported by official sources. The figures on black-on-white homicides and white-on-white homicides are wildly inaccurate. And, as several news organizations quickly noted, the ""Crime Statistics Bureau"" doesn’t exist. We looked for that agency as well and the closest we found in San Francisco were a number of crime scene clean-up services.""

###**Here is a comparison of what Trump tweeted out with actual *Facts™*:**

>Interracial homicides

>While the image references 2015, the year is not over, and no official numbers have been released. The latest data comes from the FBI for 2014. This table contrasts Trump’s figures with the official ones.

****

##**He's retweeted users with obviously racist names:**[Said tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/690562515500032000)

****

##**He's discriminated against the people of color in the past:**
>"" Donald Trump was then president of the family real estate firm, and the government amassed overwhelming evidence that the company had a policy of discriminating against blacks, including those serving in the military.

>To prove the discrimination, blacks were repeatedly dispatched as testers to Trump apartment buildings to inquire about vacancies, and white testers were sent soon after. Repeatedly, the black person was told that nothing was available, while the white tester was shown apartments for immediate rental.""

>A former building superintendent working for the Trumps explained that he was told to code any application by a black person with the letter C, for colored, apparently so the office would know to reject it. A Trump rental agent said the Trumps wanted to rent only to “Jews and executives,” and discouraged renting to blacks.

>Donald Trump furiously fought the civil rights suit in the courts and the media, but the Trumps eventually settled on terms that were widely regarded as a victory for the government. Three years later, the government sued the Trumps again, for continuing to discriminate.

###Here is another time:
>""Another revealing moment came in 1989, when New York City was convulsed by the “Central Park jogger” case, a rape and beating of a young white woman. Five black and Latino teenagers were arrested.""

>Trump stepped in, denounced Mayor Ed Koch’s call for peace and bought full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty. The five teenagers spent years in prison before being exonerated. In retrospect, they suffered a modern version of a lynching, and Trump played a part in whipping up the crowds.

###Another:

>As Trump moved into casinos, discrimination followed. In the 1980s, according to a former Trump casino worker, Kip Brown, who was quoted by The New Yorker: “When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor. … They put us all in the back.”

>In 1991, a book by John O’Donnell, who had been president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump as criticizing a black accountant and saying: “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.” O’Donnell wrote that for months afterward, Trump pressed him to fire the black accountant, until the man resigned of his own accord.

And here is the direct quote by Trump about the that person's claims:

>""Nobody has had worse things written about them than me,” Trump says. “And here I am. The stuff O'Donnell wrote about me is probably true. The guy’s a fucking loser. A fucking loser. I brought the guy in to work for me; it turns out he didn’t know that much about what he was doing. I think I met the guy two or three times total. And this guy goes off and writes a book about me, like he knows me! I understand it. He needs the money, so he uses my name to sell some books. But it must have been a lousy book because it didn’t sell any copies.”**[Source](http://www.playboy.com/articles/the-art-of-the-donald)**

2) CNN didn't blackmail anyone. They did him a favor by not releasing his name. The First Amendment protects you from the government. It doesn't stop others from using their free speech to criticize your bigotry.

Racists will cry about free speech because they know their views are not accepted in public. It's not doxxing when CNN reports your name. It's journalism.

The news reports people's names all the time. Being anonymous on 4chan and reddit doesn't give you a right to remain anonymous if you're careless with your personal information and you do something newsworthy.

3) CNN also didn't doxx anyone. Again, they did him a favor by not releasing his information. CNN was perfectly within their rights and ethics to investigate this guy because he was part of a nationally-relevant news story.

The president re-tweeting something you said makes you into a person of public interest whether you like it or not, whether you posted it semi-anonymously or not.

4) He said FAR WORSE things than the GIF:

> June 2017: HanAssholeSolo posted an image of CNN journalists and employees with a Star of David next to them writing, “Something strange about CNN...can't quite put my finger on it...” [above]

> “FBI stats don’t lie n-----. You hood rats account for more that 50% of the murder, rape, robbery, and assault in the USA.”

> “I just like dancing when n------ are getting beat down by the cops.”

> “I guess letting them [Muslims] into your country and then being killed by them if you don't conform to their stone age ideology is? You can't win with these f------ wake the f--- up the only way to win is to eradicate them 100% they cannot integrate into modern society they take over like cockroaches.”
