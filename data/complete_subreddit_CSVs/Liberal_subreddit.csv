204,Just a reminder that the U.S. could save over half a Trillion dollars PER YEAR by implementing 3 common sense legislation pieces the rest of the world already has,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/9tpooc/just_a_reminder_that_the_us_could_save_over_half/,1541233292.0,477,74," Going by the conservative estimates (from a Koch brothers funded study, that is), transferring to a single payer health care system would save on average [$200 Billion per year](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf). Medicare for all is something virtually every other developed nation has and has better outcomes than the U.S..

Furthermore, tax loopholes exploited by the wealthy with teams of lawyers result in the loss of around [$70 Billion per year](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/opinion/gabriel-zucman-paradise-papers-tax-evasion.html). Of course there will always be loopholes and even the most comprehensive legislation couldn't solve all of tax avoidance. So let's call it $50 Billion.

The final part of this trifecta is the fact the U.S. spends more on it's defense budget ($610 Billion) than the next 7 largest militaries in the world [combined](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2018/05/02/us-remains-top-military-spender-sipri-reports/). If you were to cut our defense spending in half, that would free up over $300 Billion AND we'd still be spending $77 Billion more than the second largest military budget, that being China's. Also it's important to note that most of the worlds largest militaries are our allies so that's an even further incentive to reallocate our tax dollars to something other than the military.

Add up all those saving and you wind up with a cool $555 Billion, PER YEAR.

That amount of money is enough to fund a Trillion dollar infrastructure bill to rebuild America over 10 years, which also includes a comprehensive 5G network all over the states ($100 Billion). That's enough to create tuition free college in the U.S. ([$75 Billion](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/28/487794394/hillary-s-free-tuition-promise-what-would-it-cost-how-would-it-work)), something else the rest of the developed world has. That's enough to fully restore NASA's budget to 1% of the federal budget (an additional [$30 Billion](https://www.thebalance.com/nasa-budget-current-funding-and-history-3306321)). That's enough to dive head first into complying with the Paris Climate Agreement and to combat climate change ([$150 Billion](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/02/fact-checking-trump-speech-paris-climate-agreement/102399674/) at the very high end even according to Trump...).

You add up all those ""pie in the sky"", ""ultra radical"" amounts and you still wind up with $200 Billion PER YEAR left over to spend. That could go very nicely into a tax cut to the middle and poor class, or fixing the Flint Michigan water crisis. Just for example.

Go vote this Tuesday everybody."

Ostracized, often faced with physical abuse from inmates who view their actions as heinous and detestable, many eventually commit suicide in prison. [(source)](http://abcnews.go.com/US/prison-living-hell-pedophiles/story?id=90004)

Cue Roy Moore. Not only have many 'Alabamians' doubled-down on Moore over a Democratic candidate, but the RNC has actually reversed their initial rejection of the accused candidate, and continue to fund his campaign. While I support due process in a court of law, enough substantial evidence has been provided to reasonably question Moore's fitness for public office. If I were a Republican official (especially in the current climate of sexual harassment of the past couple months), I'd want to distance my party as far as possible from the highly plausible accusations against Moore. This Faustian deal of endorsing Moore to maintain the GOP majority and pass their haphazardly constructed legislation further proves to me that even society's worst, America's criminals, will condemn a pedophile before a ""scrupulous"" Republican if votes are at stake. Sexual behavior with an adolescent or younger is predatory, wrong, and illegal, whether your name is Milo Yiannopoulos, Kevin Spacey, or Judge Roy Moore. If so many Republicans have the guile to say homosexuality is immoral, but won't stand against the sexual misconduct of their peers, then when will the GOP stop being identified as the party of moral, Christian, family values?



**TL;DR**- Why is the GOP the party of moral fiber if even the people we've deemed as dangers to society have a harsher view on pedophilia than Republicans?"

2) CNN didn't blackmail anyone. They did him a favor by not releasing his name. The First Amendment protects you from the government. It doesn't stop others from using their free speech to criticize your bigotry.

Racists will cry about free speech because they know their views are not accepted in public. It's not doxxing when CNN reports your name. It's journalism.

The news reports people's names all the time. Being anonymous on 4chan and reddit doesn't give you a right to remain anonymous if you're careless with your personal information and you do something newsworthy.

3) CNN also didn't doxx anyone. Again, they did him a favor by not releasing his information. CNN was perfectly within their rights and ethics to investigate this guy because he was part of a nationally-relevant news story.

The president re-tweeting something you said makes you into a person of public interest whether you like it or not, whether you posted it semi-anonymously or not.

4) He said FAR WORSE things than the GIF:

> June 2017: HanAssholeSolo posted an image of CNN journalists and employees with a Star of David next to them writing, “Something strange about CNN...can't quite put my finger on it...” [above]

> “FBI stats don’t lie n-----. You hood rats account for more that 50% of the murder, rape, robbery, and assault in the USA.”

> “I just like dancing when n------ are getting beat down by the cops.”

> “I guess letting them [Muslims] into your country and then being killed by them if you don't conform to their stone age ideology is? You can't win with these f------ wake the f--- up the only way to win is to eradicate them 100% they cannot integrate into modern society they take over like cockroaches.”

Meanwhile over at /r/The_Donald we have people who used to love Comey now calling him a liar etc. They are reaching as far as to claim things like ""Comey said there isn't evidence to support *Trump's specific wording* not that there isn't wiretapping!""

They can talk to witnesses willing to talk and get their statements.  They can include This any information and testimony made public from the FBI's investigation.   


**An experienced team can organize all of this evidence in one document that can be presented to the public.** It should be published online in PDF format so that anyone can read this report.  

Please tell me this is happening. I hope there people with vision and leadership within the Party or other organizations that are making this happen.  We need to have the evidence in one place, compiled and organized, and available to the public.    

This Report, along with the FBI's results of their investigation, is needed so that anyone can read the witness statements and see the evidence of past actions by Kavanaugh.     

My questions:   

- Who is doing this?  
- Pelosi, will your office offer this to the public?   
- Can we identify who is doing this or determine that no one is doing this? 
- What is needed to make this happen?   

Let's do this right. You know there is enough money and support to make this happen.

What Bannon is doing, most dramatically with last night's ban on immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries-- is creating what is known as a ""shock event."" Such an event is unexpected and confusing and throws a society into chaos. People scramble to react to the event, usually along some fault line that those responsible for the event can widen by claiming that they alone know how to restore order. When opponents speak out, the authors of the shock event call them enemies. As society reels and tempers run high, those responsible for the shock event perform a sleight of hand to achieve their real goal, a goal they know to be hugely unpopular, but from which everyone has been distracted as they fight over the initial event. There is no longer concerted opposition to the real goal; opposition divides along the partisan lines established by the shock event.

Last night's Executive Order has all the hallmarks of a shock event. It was not reviewed by any governmental agencies or lawyers before it was released, and counterterrorism experts insist they did not ask for it. People charged with enforcing it got no instructions about how to do so. Courts immediately have declared parts of it unconstitutional, but border police in some airports are refusing to stop enforcing it. 

Predictably, chaos has followed and tempers are hot.

My point today is this: unless you are the person setting it up, it is in no one's interest to play the shock event game. It is designed explicitly to divide people who might otherwise come together so they cannot stand against something its authors think they won't like. I don't know what Bannon is up to-- although I have some guesses-- but because I know Bannon's ideas well, I am positive that there is not a single person whom I consider a friend on either side of the aisle-- and my friends range pretty widely-- who will benefit from whatever it is. If the shock event strategy works, though, many of you will blame each other, rather than Bannon, for the fallout. And the country will have been tricked into accepting their real goal. 

But because shock events destabilize a society, they can also be used positively. We do not have to respond along old fault lines. We could just as easily reorganize into a different pattern that threatens the people who sparked the event. A successful shock event depends on speed and chaos because it requires knee-jerk reactions so that people divide along established lines. This, for example, is how Confederate leaders railroaded the initial southern states out of the Union. If people realize they are being played, though, they can reach across old lines and reorganize to challenge the leaders who are pulling the strings. This was Lincoln's strategy when he joined together Whigs, Democrats, Free-Soilers, anti-Nebraska voters, and nativists into the new Republican Party to stand against the Slave Power. Five years before, such a coalition would have been unimaginable. Members of those groups agreed on very little other than that they wanted all Americans to have equal economic opportunity. Once they began to work together to promote a fair economic system, though, they found much common ground. They ended up rededicating the nation to a ""government of the people, by the people, and for the people."" 

Confederate leaders and Lincoln both knew about the political potential of a shock event. As we are in the midst of one, it seems worth noting that Lincoln seemed to have the better idea about how to use it.""


The post is not mine. It originated from a person named Heather Richardson (apparently she's on the top search result for shock event). And I would appreciate it if it were shared to other left leaning forums so we can maintain focus (I would love to, but the ten minute rule). Thanks.

566,Trump's firing of U.S. Attorney might be related to Mr. Bharara becoming a nightmare for all the insider traders in the Wall Street including many of Trump's friends and associates in New York.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/5yybbp/trumps_firing_of_us_attorney_might_be_related_to/,1489347730.0,247,31,"Yes, by firing of Preet Bharara Trump has shown that he doesn't want to clean the swamp in Washington or elsewhere in the country, especially in New York where Trump grew up and where most of Trump's shady businesses are located.

Otherwise why Trump would kick out a very respected and well known U.S. Attorney like Mr. Bharara whom he promised to keep once he took total control of this country.

The question that comes to everybody's mind is maybe Mr. Bharara was too close to finding some shady deals that Trump was engaged in.

Maybe all of Trump's ruse that he was against Wall Street was nothing but to distract all of his followers from the fact that he himself had made heavy involvements with the sharks of Wall Street.

And given his very close relationship with the winners of Wall Street like Mr. Carl Icahn and Mr. Barack, Trump might've used a very significant amount of his own money through a very heavy investments in the range of billions of dollars in the stock market. 

Probably most of the venture capitalists whom Mr. Bharara was trying to put behind bars are frequent visitors to the Trump Tower exchanging pleasantries as well as sheer cash.

So it might've become quite obvious to Mr. Trump that this man Mr. Preet Bharara whom he promised to keep in his position as a Wall Street enforcer, is now becoming a pain in Trump's butt.

By going after the same people in the Wall Street, Mr. Bharara very inadvertently might've come across some big names in the hedge fund industry who were using insider trading as a way to make billions of dollars for billionaires like Trump and his partners in crime."

Actually Trump and the Republicans are still in denial that they've been left standing on their broken legs since this very shocking and a very damning C.B.O. report came out 2 days back saying very correctly that at least 24 million of our people will lose their only lifeline that Obamacare provided to them in 2010 through the Democratic healthcare bill which covered more number of Americans that anyone could dream then.

But Trump and the Republicans started denigrating this latest report long before it came out.

They didn't care that this report was compiled by the same bipartisan government agency as before. Nothing's changed.

And it's quite an irony to hear Trump complain about this report whereas he always used C.B.O. reports to cuss Obama""on economic growth,tax cuts,employment and other issues"" as mentioned in a NYT column.

But now the same Trump, who'd always shown a tendency to accept news that was favorable to him and rejected the results that pointed out his faults, is once again trying to prove to his ignorant followers that this report was biased from the very beginning.

He has no intention to tell them the truth that C.B.O. office has equal number of Democrats and Republicans in it.

Yes Trump is the same man, who denounced the job numbers when it said the number of jobless Americans are much lower since Obama came in, blaming the report on Obama's henchmen, is now touting the higher number of American employed in February as if it happened because of him.

For Trump the lower unemployment numbers could never happen if he didn't win the presidential election.

He also takes credit for higher growth and the rise in stock market telling his under educated followers that Dow Jones Industrial marker was going down when Obama was president but shot up since he came into power. 

And that is nothing but bull since DJI markers long passed 19,000 points under Obama."

She was married for 24 years.  She loved being married, and her husband was a good guy.  He didn't give a damn about politics.

Then we elected a black president, and he lost his shit.  Suddenly politics are all he thinks about.  He started stockpiling provisions for the coming apocalypse.  He couldn't understand how his wife didn't see that the world was coming to an end.  It took a toll on their marriage, and they divorced a few years ago.

Conservatives make me so incredibly agitated with their lies and their ignorance and their harmful policies and their glorification of ignorance and getting people to vote against their rational self-interest through fear. 


I'm single and make good money (well within the top 5%). **I would be willing to pay a significantly higher tax burden in order to live in a country with a a less-conservative conservative party.** 


Somewhere where I have a 50% top tax rate but the government provides national healthcare to all and a retirement pension and actual infrastructure and positive policies designed to alleviate poverty and encourage growth? And I don't have to deal with a party of politicians who prey on ignorance and fear and lie to their voters in order to get reelected so they can line their own pockets?

Never mind the fact that Obama began his presidency almost exactly 65 years after the end of WWII.
Never mind the fact that college enrollment hit record highs under the Obama presidency.
Never mind the endless string of fact checks pointing out these nuances and others showing why that number is where it is.
The criticism was based on the number alone, and mitigating factors were discussed rarely, if ever.
I'd say it's time to start talking about this statistic, if only to point out that there's more to labor force participation than just this number.
