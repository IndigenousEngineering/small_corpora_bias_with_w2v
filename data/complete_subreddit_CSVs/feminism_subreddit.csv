I dunno if you saw that post the other day, but it was about the use of the term ""fuckzoned"" to describe someone who only gave value to the sexual aspect of some and lack of regard for their want to make a friend.


Anyway I brought up how he had essentially fuckzoned this girl and I've never seen someone go so red in embarrassment. It just instantly fucked with his resentment, and I could see a realisation in him that he probably didn't want to accept as he wouldn't talk to me the rest of the nightahahaha

Edit: lol at seeing all the comments of disbelief, as if no one ever got really embarrssed before when they got called out amongst their peers for being sexist? We were at a party for my friend finishing his PhD thesis and this creep was there and I was rum drunk and very loud about my distaste for this prick who was definitely not my friend or acquaintance. I might have exaggerated his unique redness tho, so I apologize there. It's not like everyone on the bus got up and  clapped, my mates said they didn't even notice till I said about it today but aye whatever 
Regardless of whether ye can believe this completely unbelievable story, it's a fucking good term

113,The clitoris is as easy to dissect as a finger. The nerves are about the same size (2-4 mm at the base and 1-2 mm where they dive to enter glans). Please clap to show support for dissemination of this anatomy. Better photos from my dissection study will be published soon.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/9tn2c7/the_clitoris_is_as_easy_to_dissect_as_a_finger/,1541214464.0,971,62,"https://link.medium.com/UG1e7jIxwR 

I know I‚Äôve posted before, but I really would appreciate more claps and shares. I have now dissected 7 clitoris with my father (plastic surgeon - I know it‚Äôs so awkward), and his plastic surgery residents. I was not able to get OB/GYNs interested in a study (unless they are doing it without, as one said she ‚Äúmight‚Äù), but you‚Äôll see support from one in a comment on my article. My ultimate goal is to influence them. 

I cannot share our photos yet, and they would probably gross most laypeople out, but they are the best ever taken. We even got cross sections where you can see how big the nerves are. I want the first correct illustrations of cross-sections to be based on them. 

I care about this because my clitoris was denervated due to pervasive physician ignorance of this anatomy. I need to change it to protect other women. Also, these nerves are large enough to potentially repair when injured. But surgeons first have to know where they are. Physical causes of sexual dysfunction should be understood so that women are not gaslighted and told it is just psychological. This is also important for any trans men who might be transiting.

The clitoral body is larger than most people realize. Lepidi and Di Marino reported the average length of the descending segment (part that looks like a penile shaft basically) is 3.24 cm on average, not including the 5.1  mm length of the glans. Our measurements, from where the clitoris attaches to the pubic bone to the base of the glans (‚Äúcorona‚Äù) have been 28 mm, 29 mm, 30 mm, 32 mm, and 35 mm (the first 2 were not measured). The body is also wider than recognized but we haven‚Äôt measured width except in one (sorry! It‚Äôs hard for me to control the measurements we take - I had to fight for the body lengths). 

The nerves are MUCH bigger than most doctors recognize. They were dissectible all the way up to the glans in most. I feel like it‚Äôs not a coincidence that they were dissectible within 2 mm of the glans in the last 4 dissected while I was there last weekend, but not in the first. Maybe it isn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to follow these nerves out, but my dad says they are no harder to dissect than nerves in the finger. And they are larger than facial nerves surgeons learn in detail. 

The nerves are absolutely the most critical for female sexual function. They are important. They should be known, especially by surgeons doing surgery in this area. Clitoral anatomy should also be covered in the same depth as penile anatomy in sexual medicine literature. The clitoris is equal in importance to the penis to sexual response. 

This is a feminist issue because the reason this anatomy is so lacking is because of the way female sexuality is approached in our culture. This anatomy was illustrated accurately by Kobelt in 1844 (he shows more branching, but there has been variability in branching), but disappeared when doctors realized the clitoris was not involved in conception and Freud insisted on the vaginal orgasm. To this day, female orgasm is often seen as less important due to a lack of a direct role in reproduction. This is wrong. "

Our analysis shows that job loss is somewhat higher among white women and men who file sexual harassment charges, while retaliation is somewhat higher for black women. ""

[https://theconversation.com/nearly-all-sexual-harassment-at-work-goes-unreported-and-those-who-do-report-often-see-zero-benefit-108378](https://theconversation.com/nearly-all-sexual-harassment-at-work-goes-unreported-and-those-who-do-report-often-see-zero-benefit-108378)

&#x200B;

Main findings:

*   About 5 million employees are sexually harassed at work every year 
   * The overwhelming majority (99.8%) of people who experience sexual harassment at work never file formal charges 
   * Of those who file formal charges, very few‚Äîwe estimate less than 1,500 per year‚Äîgo to court. 
*  Most employers react punitively toward people who file formal sexual harassment charges. 
   * 68% of sexual harassment charges include an allegation of employer retaliation, this rate is highest for Black women. 
   * 64% of sexual harassment charges are associated with job loss, and this rate is highest for White women and White men. 
*  Industries vary widely in their sexual harassment discrimination charge rates. 
   *  In all industries women are more likely than men to file charges, but this sex difference grows in male dominated industries. 
* While the EEOC initially tends to judge sexual harassment charges as more likely than other discrimination complaints to sustain a finding of legal cause, most individuals benefit little from EEOC case processing 
   *  27% of employees who file a sexual harassment charge with the EEOC and continue to pursue redress, receive any benefit 
      *  23% receive some monetary compensation 
      *  the average award is $24,700, the median award is $10,000 
      *  less than 1% of awards are over $100,000 
      *  Only 12% of charges lead to a managerial agreement to change workplace practices 
* Our conclusion from these results is that sexual harassment, and perhaps discrimination of all types, should be addressed proactively and affirmatively as managerial responsibilities, rather than leaving it to the targets of discrimination to pursue legal remedies as individuals.

a long ass P.S.

I've seen some 'traditional western guys' trying to talk to me on the internet just cause I'm asian, saying shit like ""Oh, the family tradition is ruined in western countries, I'd like to date an asian girl, bla bla. Can they just go to the nearest bridge and throw themselves over it? We ask misogynists to jump over a river here - mainly cause a guy that shouted meminism threw himself over a river to prove that meminism is right. He didn't intentionally kill himself, he just threw himself over a river cause he was good at swimming and it was all for good show. He got unlucky and a metal pole penetrated his ass in the Han river-no joke. His name was jaggy sung, so when Korean feminists say 'can you jaggy yourself' or 'moves like jaggy' to a misogynist, it means go and kill yourself. Stop harassing Korean girls cause it's no diff here.

*****IF YOU ARE A ""NICE GUY"" WHO CLAIMS TO RESPECT WOMEN, BUT TURN AROUND AND CALL US ""BITCHES"" ""SLUTS"" ""FEMINAZI'S"" WHEN WE REFUSE YOUR ROMANTIC OR SEXUAL ADVANCES, THIS POST IS NOT FOR YOU. I, AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS, ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR OPINIONS ON HOW WOMEN (AND MEN) ARE TREATED. WE ARE NOT HERE TO LISTEN TO YOU DEFEND YOURSELF.*****

I was at the bar earlier, walking back in from having a smoke, and some wife-beater-wearing-fuck-boy GRABS my waist, forcibly pulls me in, and demands that I kiss him. I looked at him and with a calm, but VERY stern voice, told him to let go of me, and to not touch me again. He was persistent, grabbing me with more force and continuing to demand that I kiss him.. 

He did not let go of me or stop grabbing me until I looked at his group of guy friends with a stare that said ""come get your fucking dog off of me"". One of them stepped in and told him to forget about it, they were leaving anyways. Only then did this asshole loosen his grip and walk away from me. 

WHY DO YOU RESPECT YOUR FRIEND TELLING YOU TO STOP MORE THAN YOU RESPECT A WOMAN YOU DONT EVEN KNOW TELLING YOU TO STOP? So I'm really angry.

Not once did I give even the slightest indication that he could touch me. I honestly didn't even notice his presence until he put his hands on me. I should have hit him square in the face right then and there, after I very clearly told him to take his hands off of me and he refused.

But that's the problem right? Us ""feminazis"" are overreacting. We are ""violent"". Our cries for help and our demands for personal space and respect, our screams of being uncomfortable, it is just us ""crazy bitches, sluts, whores"" getting what we deserve. 

This has turned into a drawn-out ramble, I am aware. But I think its very important. I guess the main message I want people to take away is, instead of saying ""NOT ALL MEN"" try saying ""THE MEN THAT ARE GIVING YOU A HARD TIME NEED TO BE STOPPED"". Once again, a very important PSA from yours truly.

ALSO, why am I being made to feel like I was in the wrong? Why am I made to feel like I should have brushed it off because he was drunk? Why am I trying to make excuses for HIS obscene and brash behavior? 

For far too long, men and women who have been harassed or abused in any way have felt the need to make excuses for their abusers behavior. ""They were drunk."" ""I started the argument."" ""They are only angry because they care so much."" 

THAT IS ENOUGH. NO MORE EXCUSES. Drunk guy at the bar isn't being held accountable for his actions? Then neither am I, tell your face to say hello to the curb üôÉ"

Like telling them how to dress and not to go get drunk isn‚Äôt gonna work all the time and is also saying that if they ever do such things, they should expect themselves to be raped, causing to believe they only have themselves to blame when it does happen. What this does is that it leads to is a culture of victim-blaming and lack of reporting of sexual violence that needs to stop. People often say this is only a problem in Muslim countries, but it's an issue we need to combat regardless of what country we live in. Even in ""developed"" places like Japan and the US people are often kicked out of the house and take the blame for being raped and ending up with an unwanted child. Again, it should never be a girl‚Äôs fault if she does get raped , instead we should be teaching our boys not to rape. Rape is only the fault of the rapist. Period. 

A common argument to this is to just not go out with random strangers you meet at a party or bar. The problem with this is that nobody is deliberately going to clubs so they can get raped and some aren't going there for the sake of having sex or meeting someone. That's like saying if you go to a sporting event, don't be surprised if someone tries to attack you because of a Jersey you're wearing, and that would never be socially acceptable behaviour. Often times the rapist could even be some random guy who found a random girl on the street and not even bother trying to talk to the victim. Rape is about power, not attraction. Hell, there are cases where refusing to go with a man can trigger a man to want to rape. Rape isn't about attraction, it's about asserting power. The Junko Furuta case is a good example of this. Even when you're not at a bar, you can even be at school or on your commute home and some guys are still gonna try to find a way to rape you no matter what preparation you made. If anything, the culture of victim blaming needs to stop because that's the kind of mentality often taught in the media and sometimes reinforced by parents. That's why it's important to teach our kids especially that they shouldn't rape.

Two men who sexually assaulted a female soldier in Korean army for ""being lesbian"" both separately have been found not guilty by the High Court for Armed Forces.

in  2010, a female soldier ""A"" was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Lieutenant Commander ""B"" and was made pregnant.

After she got an abortion, she told Commander ""A"" what happened, but instead, he sexually assaulted her as well. 

According to her, after she told ""B"" about her sexuality, he replied ""That's because you don't know about men. I'll teach you how it feels"" and sexually assaulted her.

Suffering from PTSD, she reported it in 2016 and the perpetrators were arrested last September.

 She pressed charges against them, in a first trial, ""B"" was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and ""A"" to 8 years.  But the HCAF overturned the first ruling, acquitting ""B"" today(Nov. 19. 2018). Commander ""A"" was already acquitted on Nov. 8.

287,"I just watched ""Feminists"" on Netflix. It has completely changed how I see the world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/9s9nub/i_just_watched_feminists_on_netflix_it_has/,1540812718.0,559,58,"I am 25 years old. I am from Canada. I have always taken equality for granted. Within my living memory, I have perceived little to no inequality. I was not raised by a feminist. My mother was a strong, independent woman who was the breadwinner for our family. I always assumed that women's rights have been entrenched in society for a very long time. I don't know exactly how long ago I assumed that these rights were achieved, but I never really thought about it.

I just finished watching the Netflix documentary ""Feminists."" I don't even know what prompted me to press play. But oh boy, was it an eye-opener. The images of the rallies, the stories from women who had terrible experiences, and they're not even that old. It wasn't so long ago.

I had no idea how much these women had fought for. They built a better world for me, and I took it for granted. Some of them, I even knew of in some capacity, but nothing beyond the superficial surface of their work. What especially bothered me as I watched the documentary was the memories of my family making fun of Jane Fonda because of the time that she had done aerobics videos. I wonder if they knew about her contributions to furthering women's rights, or if they chose to just ignore this and reduce her to a ditzy actress, just in it for the money.

I cried a few times during the documentary. I want to reach out to these women and thank them for all they've done to make the world a better place for the next generations. It's so sad how people my age view feminism now; we don't fully grasp why it's necessary and so many people equate it with ""man-hating."" I myself am guilty of shying away from the term, preferring to say ""egalitarian"" when asked. From now on, I will be proud to say I am a feminist, and will dedicate time to learning about the history from which I benefit.

Thanks for listening."

She was allegedly being held as a sex slave at the home of Jeffrey Epstein, who was a friend of Trump's and is a convicted pedophile with a preference for young girls. After the alleged attack from Trump ended, the girl says Epstein proceeded to rape her. An employee of Epstein's witnessed the rape and corroborates the survivor's story. Trump has been accused of a violent rape before by his ex-wife Ivana Trump, and of attempted rape by a former business colleague.

The mainstream media hasn't reported on this lawsuit, reminiscent of the underreporting of the Cosby rape allegations for over a decade. Another sign that the media reflects the interests of the wealthy and powerful. Infuriating.

A campaign group has recently begun to raise awareness of the issue of hysteroscopy (a test used in cases of suspected cancer, so not something women can really refuse) after a large number of women undergoing the procedure reported excruciating pain, as well as inadequate information on what to expect during the procedure. Many now suffer with PTSD. One patient reported a nurse telling her afterwards that they ""didn't warn women how painful it was because they would refuse to come"". 

Instead, women are simply being told simply to take paracetamol, which is in no way effective against the pain involved in having instruments poking around in your cervix and often surgery to remove polyps etc as well. An invasive and poteni humiliating operation with no anaesthesia. Just let that sink in! All because cost savings are needed and women are seen as more likely to put up with it. Don't forget that similar endoscopy type procedures also performed on men are ALWAYS done with an offer of sedation.

Healthcare has a proud history of underplaying women's pain, pushing us towards ineffective 'natural' methods of relief and underplaying the severity of our suffering. While many individuals in the system are truly compassionate, there is a tradition of throwing women under the bus when it comes to cost cutting. To make matters worse, we are less likely to be listened to when we do complain, and are made to feel that it is someone our duty to put up with pain without 'making a fuss'.

I urge all of you to help spread the word on this issue which is understandably very hard for the campaigners to get people to engage with. 

There is a petition on Change.org where you can object to this barbaric practice - and it could do with a bit more support. 

https://www.change.org/p/secretary-of-state-for-health-end-barbaric-nhs-hysteroscopies-with-inadequate-pain-relief

Please, please do sign if you feel as angry about this as I do!

Edit: and please pass this on to your friends, family and feminist contacts as the biggest problem this campaign faces is the taboo subject matter.

Thanks so much"

Help?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/3rs9n6/im_a_feminist_blogger_who_is_being_censored_by/,1446859223.0,384,44,"Hi Redditor Feminists,
I'm in an ongoing battle with Facebook's ad department over the definition of a tampon as a health product as opposed to, say, a dildo.

Here's what happened:

I wrote a post for my blog, Bad-ass Motherblogger, about the history of menstrual products. Part of my marketing strategy is to boost posts on my Facebook page. However, Facebook keeps disapproving my ad because it violates their ""Adult Products Policy."" As in, they consider tampons and pads to be sexual devices. 

When I appealed the rejection, they changed their story and I was informed that my preview image (an 18th century painting of women bathing) contained ""too much skin."" and it violated the Nudity Policy. 

So I changed the preview image to a historical print of Hypatia being dragged through the streets of Alexandria (cuz violence to women is so much less offensive than women bathing). 

The ad was rejected again. The reason: ""Ads are not allowed to promote the sale or use of adult products or services, including toys, videos, publications, live shows or sexual enhancement products.""

*sigh*

I don't know about you, but when I think about using a tampon or a menstrual pad, the last thing I think about is sex. 

here's a link to screenshots of the Facebook messages, just to assure you this is real and not a self-promotional post:

https://www.flickr.com/photos/137559024@N02/shares/30i763/

Women's health shouldn't be a taboo subject. If you agree with me, can you please bring attention to this issue? 

Just to give you an idea of how boosting impacts the reach of a post: I have 730 ""likes"" for my page, yet without an ad, the post has only been seen by 8 people over the past 24 hours. 

It scares me that advocates for women's health and gender equality may not be able to share their message with a wider audience because the largest social media platform on the Internet thinks women's health products reside in the same category as sex toys.

Here's the link to my blog post, in case you're curious: 

http://www.mommybloggerforhire.com/badassmotherblogger/on-the-rag-menstrual-products-from-ancient-greece-to-the-americas

The suppression of the reach of content about women's health based on an arbitrary ""adult product"" policy is misguided at best. 

Women have had similar problems with Facebook censoring posts featuring breastfeeding mothers, and until enough people took notice, any picture of a breastfeeding mother and child could be deleted due to ""nudity."" 

So I'm asking, not just for me, but for other advocates of women's health: take notice. Women's bodies aren't sexual objects and menstrual products (which many girls in poverty-stricken countries or in cultures that have negative superstitions about menstruation can't get access to) are not sexual devices. Let's take the shame out of women's health so we can address these issues openly and without fear of censorship.

Thanks,

Alaura Weaver

Ps, it's come to my attention that my profile was shadowbanned because some users have interpreted this as spam or self-promotional. I assure you I'm in no way seeking personal gain on this other than hopefully a change to Facebook's ad policy and better yet a discussion of the double standards and puritanical attitudes regarding women's health. I've removed language from this post  asking for social media shares, but in this day and age, that's the best way to increase awareness on issues. I've asked Reddit admins to remove the ban and ask the community to kindly rethink reporting requests for social action as spam."

It's weird to me that people throw a whole party to reveal what genitals their unborn child has. It invites family members and friends to make judgements and predictions about your baby before they're even here.

I get that it's extremely exciting to learn more about your baby as you progress in pregnancy, but I personally feel that you lose an intimate moment by making such a huge deal about a body part. Besides that, we all know that female and male babies are treated differently the moment they are born. So let's stop treating unborn children like their personalities and preferences can be assumed."

I recently started working for a landscaping company as the only female. My boss has never hired a female before,  I made it clear to him beforehand that I was woman to try and decrease the shock factor when I showed up for interview. I have a lot of experience working in this field my family had their own business for years and every weekend and school holiday this is exactly what I did.

I'm a fit individual, I love to workout (lift weights), hike, be outdoors, play sports, and I loveeee to work hard. My boss could see that I was in shape and was ready to work. He was very confident in me and didn't question the fact that I'm a small woman (5ft 4, 130lbs) and hired me on the spot to come in the next day. 

None of my crew members down play the fact that I am woman working with all males, lifting heavy equipment, digging holes, literally rolling around in mud, mowing, weed eating, and sweating my ass for for 10 hours of the day everyday. Most the time I can out work them and just keep going! My boss ensures that I do everything that the men do he doesn't treat me or act towards in any different way. 

However, customers and clients are a whole different story! The most used phrases or statements that are aimed towards me;

\- Wow you work hard for a girl.

\- Hard working girls are a rare breed, he is lucky to have you.

\- You do everything the guys do?!

\- Are you sure you can lift that, get one of the boys to do it!

\- You don't mind being outside and getting all dirty and sweaty?!

\- How long can you been working here (with the perception that its just been a couple of weeks and ill quit real soon). 

All of these comments hurt my soul and make me really angry. I understand some people are innocently saying these phrases or asking me these questions but wow open your eyes and listen to yourself. 

I work hard for a girl; what does that even mean. At what percentage or level of effort have I surpassed the woman's capability to work. Am i supposed to just stop once I being to tread in ""the male territory"" of working hard. 

Hard working girls are a rare breed; No we are not. There are PLENTY of hard working females in this world. You just don't open your eyes to it, physical labor isn't the only way to be classed as a hard worker. There are women staying up all hours of the night looking after children, sitting at a desk all night long trying to solve some crazy murder case, women in third world countries trying to fight hunger, and women researching cures for diseases. There are so many powerful, strong, and hardworking women everywhere you look. We are not a RARE breed. 

I could continue my rant of how this makes me feel and how women are subjected to being beneath males in all different types of workforce. But please don't question me or ability and just let me do my job because I am actually really great at it. "

625,Tip: feminist men talking over or telling women how they should feel is pretty anti feminist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/a3kwxd/tip_feminist_men_talking_over_or_telling_women/,1544102522.0,349,58,"So I'm a lady lol and it seems to come up a lot in my life that there will be self proclaimed cis men that are feminists which is great because idk why not? Lol anyways

My problem lies in when I say I am or am not feeling oppressed by something a feminist man seems to want to tell me how I'm suppose to feel about the subject. 

Clearly all women are different and have different things that make them feel oppressed or uncomfortable or whatever and that is your own life and everyone can feel how they want.

Personally I've had a lot of issues with rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment and that's probably the main thing and one of the few I truly feel oppressed about. 

I grew up with and hung out with a lot of guys. I lived in a small town so people around my age were hard to find. I would workout with them, play video games, watch movies, etc. They are probably some of my best friends ever.

But constantly I will hear from feminist men that don't understand my situation or bother to ask me how I feel that will tell me why my best guy friends are oppressing me.

I understand someone being concerned for others, but they don't oppress me they treat me 100% equal. They will expect me to do everything at an equal level to them and they will laugh at my jokes and let me pick movies out the same amount as everyone else in the group. We do make really bad jokes and I know they are joking and not really being mean.

I also will have feminist men telling me what I should let my fiance say to me. My fiance is probably the most down to earth person in the world. We both know what we can and can't do/ say to each other. If he was doing something I didn't like or thought was oppressive I would 100% tell him.

These situations also come up in just how I dress, act, etc not just how men treat me.

I have news for you: yes be an ally and help people in the oppressed group that is awesome, but you aren't really helping the oppressed group when you tell them what they can't do or say and telling them how they are suppose to think and feel.

You can't be a male feminist and also tell me how I should feel about something and try to shut up my feelings on the subject. "

627,Fed up with my customers. How do you respond to microaggressions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/8roco7/fed_up_with_my_customers_how_do_you_respond_to/,1529233758.0,353,129,"I'm a barista. 

Every day, I hear men laugh at themselves or others for ordering what they consider ""girly"" drinks. 

I have one customer who orders theirs with almond milk, and every day without fail, his friends tease him for it. 

Last week, a man ordered a latte. He said, ""And throw some of that sissy stuff in it."" 

I said, ""Sissy stuff?"" 

""Yeah, that girly bullshit.""

""I don't know what you mean by that.""

""That shit over there"" \*points to syrup pumps\*

""Oh. I think that's just called sweetener.""

One of the most infuriating moments was months ago, when a woman ordered a black coffee and left. The next customer, a man, laughed and said, ""Do you think that drink was for her, or her boss?"" Implying that 1) No woman drinks black coffee, 2) This woman was someone's assistant, and 3) Her boss was man, who of course drinks black coffee.

I'm honestly tired of it. Every day, it's either the drinks, men calling me love/sweetie/honey, male coworkers taking over a job to ""help"" me when I'm perfectly capable myself, or something else. 

What do you do when you come across little things like this? Obviously a single action or comment is small in isolation, and no decent human does or says these things to intentionally hurt me or others. Still, I firmly believe that these small actions and comments are what make up our institutionalized sexism. 

How often do you let these things slide? How often do you call them out? Do you have rules for yourself when calling them out (e.g. never at work, only when it feels safe to do so, or only if this person is a repeat offender)? How direct are you when you call out this behavior (i.e. Do you challenge superficially *""I can lift this myself, actually""* or more deeply *""I think you only offered to carry this for me because I'm a woman.""*)?

**TL;DR:**

My customers and coworkers say/do small and passively sexist things, like most of the world. I oscillate between wanting to stand up for myself and wanting to let it slide. How do you handle subtly sexist actions/comments?"

I just don't understand how so many people can just sit back and say ""women have it all, they have all the rights and just want special treatment"". Do people not understand that sexism is definitely still affecting society negatively? Society, meaning both men and women.

I guess it just makes me sad that feminism seems to be a dirty word. I think the idea of fair and equal representation shouldn't be hard to get behind, but I feel like any time any gendered issue comes up everyone just goes crazy. Logically, feminism makes sense to me. As a woman, why should I be in an inferior position in society? It seems crazy that 50% of the population should just be excluded from the conversation. I'm almost scared to present myself as a woman on the internet, but at the same time if I can't be myself what's the point of being on a site that is user driven? 

I've been forcing myself to get into some conversations that might make me uncomfortable, because I honestly can't just sit by and watch sexism all around me without saying anything anymore. I'd like to think that people are just uneducated about certain issues and are sane enough to be able to have mature conversations about realistic problems we are facing. 

I came to this subreddit hoping for a little solidarity and a break from just so much casual sexism. I hope you guys have a wonderful day, and make sure to remember that you have a voice. It's okay to have a voice."

In an r/askreddit thread, I made the mistake of implying that patriarchy exists, *(shock horror!)* and that its values can have negative effects for men as well as women. (e.g. Motherhood is a woman's 'natural role' therefore men are at a disadvantage I'm custody battles).


People seemed to get quite pissed off about it and assume that I hate all men...which was certainly not what I wanted to convey. I explained my point roughly as I did above. It's not something that I'm upset about. Explained myself calmly and rationally and even made light of the situation.

So is my experience unique? Do you guys find larger subs like Askreddit jump on feminist-leaning comments with a lot of vitriol without seeming to actually address your point? Maybe I live in a liberal bubble but I was quite surprised to the reaction to what I considered an innocuous comment. 

Sorry if this post is inappropriately placed here. I've read the rules and I think it should be ok. "

Reactions in /r/cringepics:

""every time i see this image, i think ""i'm not a target for violence, so all other women can go fuck themselves."""" - top comment, love the sarcasm

""Feminism is all about taking responsibility for your actions and has nothing to do with disrespecting men. I think if most people read the definition of feminism, hit hey would find that they are actually feminists.""

Reactions in /r/no_sob_story:

""This is some of the worst reddit-bait I've ever seen. This is so pandering to the reddit audience that it's not funny.""

""I'm sure the comments are full of the same high quality that makes up this picture. The passive aggressive hate towards anything resembling feminism is ridiculous on reddit.""

""I think I don't need feminism because: ""I take for granted the many gains feminism has already made in the past century.""

""I sincerely hope someone else gave that girl a sign and told her to pose with it, because seriously, ""I respect men. I refuse to demonize them and blame them for my problems""? Feminism has nothing to do with blame or demonizing; if a feminist is blaming anything on men, s/he is by definition not a feminist. If you favor fair treatment of the sexes, you're a feminist. It's called that because females are historically favored against. (For example, see: any history book). What a steamy load of shit.""

Reactions in /r/pics: 

""This is pure reddit-bait. I can hear the fedoras tipping.""

""Yep, I would defend feminism and outline the issues with this girl's attempt at mocking it, but then I remember the main demographic of reddit is white 18-25 year old men and I just close the internet browser and read a book.""

Group 2: This is often the same argument that the conservative right use when they perpetuate transmisogyny and refuse to give trans children access to bathrooms and women only spaces. 

The first group describes themselves as radical and enlightened. The second group is described by the first group as haters, backwards people.

Am I missing something here? What is radical and rational about denying trans children the access to bathrooms, and how is the interpretation of what a woman is, stuck in the 17th century radical and enlightened?

Okay, so according to group 1 you have to have female organs to be considered a woman. But many women have no uteruses, no vaginas etc because of illness or prolapse. So these women aren't ""real women"" to them.

Group 2 considers women who don't have an uterus to be defect and not a ""real woman"". Classical misogyny by the right.

Honestly, I've spent some hours thinking about this type of feminism and every argument they use is either parroted by the conservative right or have misogynist roots.

How did this type of feminism survive? How can someone call themselves feminist but at the same time use misogynyst argument to dehumanize transwomen. What is going on? "

The convention was held in Seneca Falls, New York, now known as the Seneca Falls Convention. Some of its key organizers were Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Coffin Mott, and Martha Coffin Wright. The principal author of the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments was Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who based it on the form of the United States Declaration of Independence. According to the North Star, published by Frederick Douglass, whose attendance at the convention and support of the Declaration helped pass the resolutions put forward, the document was the ""grand movement for attaining the civil, social, political, and religious rights of women.""

In pop culture feminism has become synonymous with man-hating. You can see this just by going on the comments section of any ""neutral"" news site that has an article on feminism, let's say, BBC News. Often you will see many commenters, even women, saying ""All feminists do is hate men. Feminism sucks!""

I'm not going to argue here whether feminism encourages man hating. What I'm going to talk about is how those people who vocally oppose feminism because of its ""anti-equality"" blatantly ignore The Manosphere.

There are a few subreddits that can be included in the Manosphere. The first is incels. This has been banned, but incels now have discussions elsewhere on the internet. Incels stands for ""involuntary celibates"". Their ideology states that it is women's fault that these men are virgins. Women are too stupid, selfish and vain to appreciate these fine men for who they really are. They have advocated for all women to become sex slaves and other atrocities. If you want to see some examples of incels in action you can always go to the IncelTears subreddit.

Keep in mind that Reddit allowed this subreddit to be active for years, despite users talking about violence against women. The subreddit was only taken down when a user talked about committing violence against a ""Chad"" (A Chad is a man that is desired by women).

Another subreddit is MGTOW. This stands for ""Men Going Their Own Way"". One look at their subreddit will tell you that these people are indeed failing to go their own way. The point is to encourage men to be independent from women and to avoid relationships and marriage with them. This would be fine if they did not spend their days posting misogynistic nonsense and memes on their subreddit. One of their favourite things to do is to post articles of female criminals and circlejerk about how bad women are. Of course, nothing is posted when a male criminal is in the news for being particularly bad.

Finally, The Red Pill is, I would argue, the most misogynistic subreddit. This is a subreddit for pick up artists. These men base their lives around seducing women for the sole purpose of sex. They post about how women are basically children, yet despite this still continue to try and have sex with them; this has pedophilic vibes. They post about how to emotionally abuse women and even physically abuse them, with posts about how to overcome ""last minute resistance"" during sex (basically rape). This subreddit is so dangerous because it actually encourages men to go outside and talk to women. Their ideology teaches them that women are attracted to awful, misogynistic men. They encourage subscribers to be racist to women of colour because they think that that will seduce them, for example. The subreddit treats women as if they are all a hive mentality and that these pick up techniques will work on all women. In fact, in their own words, AWALT: All Women are Like That.

Keep in mind that the last two subreddits are still up with many subscribers. The content policy of Reddit states that content is prohibited if it is is illegal and encourages/incites violence. Hate speech is undeniably illegal. Additionally, there have been many posts on The Red Pill encouraging men to be non-consensually violent towards their female sexual partners. I don't know what Reddit is thinking in allowing this community to remain active.

I don't think feminism can even begin to compare to these subreddits. It saddens me how feminism has become a joke and that the average person if asked on the street on what their opinion of feminism is might say that it's just ""man-hating"". Meanwhile the Manosphere is actually misogynistic and I don't see mainstream YouTubers making countless ""Rekt MGTOW"" compilations. I think that this shows how the idea of a woman hating men is extremely unacceptable, but far right wing men can get away with misogyny. Hatred should not be acceptable, period. If these people genuinely believe that feminist ideology promotes the hatred of men and anti-equality, then they should definitely be outraged at the content that comes out of the Manisphere. I don't see videos being made on Jordan Peterson's blatant sexism but here we have Rekt Feminist Compliation #203 where someone asked for their pronouns to be respected.

One example of a hypocritical person is Ethan from H3H3. I stopped watching his content due to the influx of ""Rekt feminist"" videos. He frequently talked about how feminism was man hating and how he actually wants equality. He never made any videos on incels or The Red Pill, even though they are more in the mainstream now after Elliot Rodger and similar criminals. He has a podcast where he only invites right wing male YouTubers. He's really showing how much he supports equality there!"

However, the very fact that they're here only furthers our need for feminist activism. The fact that they're here, arguing us, makes it seem like they need to approve of our opinions before we, as women, can have them. This is what feminism has always fought.

So to MRA reading this: I'm sorry, I didn't know women needed a man's approval before they could have opinions. This only makes your whole MRA campaign seem more bigoted and misogynistic, though I'm sure that doesn't bother you. We're here to talk about feminism and issues pertaining to women, and you try to bring a male point of view, or try to force your opinion of women onto us, as if we can't have our own.

This is for all the people who went to jail for their race when a white person went free. This is for all the people discriminated against for being Muslim in a Christian country, or Christian in a Muslim country, or for being simply the """"""wrong"""""" religion in any country.

**I love you.**

I think you're fucking phenomenal. 

I think you're an amazing, special, unique human being who has every right to be treated fairly. 

Your feminism isn't ""misguided"". It's brave, and powerful, and fighting against the forces of oppression that have held people of every minority and oppressed group back for so many millennia.

Your sexuality, your romantic orientation, your gender identity isn't ""a phase"". It's a beautiful and wonderful part of who you are, a shining beacon of diversity that shows everyone around you ""we are humans, and we are all special, beautiful and should be true to ourselves!"" Share your love with everyone you love, no matter who they are, because there is no such thing as too much shared love in the world, no matter what gender or presentation person it comes from.

Your philosophies and your religion aren't ""heretical"" or ""evil"". They're the sacred callings that guide you to bring honesty, love, justice and truth to the world, no matter how many around you try to suppress you. Whether you're Jewish or Sikh, atheist or spiritual, Christian or Hindu, Zoroastrian or Muslim, your philosophies, your religions and your personal truths are there to guide you to make the world a better place, and when you use them to help all around you they make you a wonderful, compassionate person no matter what hateful others might say.

Your skin colour isn't ""dirty"", your race isn't a social punching bag or a joke. Your ethnicity and culture are vibrant and gorgeous parts of the diversity of human experiences, shaped by time, place, hearts, and minds. Your cultural body presentations, your beautifully individual physical forms, and your unique minds and experiences will never make you a lesser person. No matter how many people try to tell you that you're inferior, or second-class, or should be punished simply for being different, your ethnicity, race, cultures and subcultures are the truest expression of human vitality against any odds. 

Your disabilities don't make you ""broken"", and invisible disabilities never make you a ""faker"". You never asked to be in pain, to be immobile, to have to fight against your own body and mind in order to do that which the able-bodied take for granted. You never asked for an immune system that turned against you, or for anxiety to cripple your every decision, or for your nerves to revolt at the slightest touch. And yet even with so much stacked against you, you're stronger than any able-bodied person can ever be. You fight not just the world but your own body, and you win every single day. You are the most powerful people ever seen, and never let anybody convince you that you're not, no matter WHAT your disabilities or abilities may be.

Keep fighting for the truth that all people are equal, that no matter what may shape your identities, no matter what your bodies may look like or how they may function, no matter who you love or how you love them. Our feminism, our religions, our queer identities, our abilities, our races and many more things may make people want to hold us down, but we have proven so many times in the past that we are stronger, that we will never ever give up. We fought for the vote, pulled it out from beneath the fists of the oppressors and gave it to our sisters. We called for equal pay and equal protections, for the rights to control our bodies and minds as we saw fit. We are still fighting our battles, women, men, and everyone in between fighting to have all people seen as equals. 

I love your strength.

I love your uniqueness.

I love your passion and your power.

I love your compassion and care.

I love you all, and know that all of you are beautiful.

###I hope you all love yourselves as much as you all deserve to be loved.

People will tell us that we should wear more makeup, wear less makeup, show more cleavage, show less skin, do our hair into ""professional"" styles, stop putting hair into ""unnatural"" styles. They will tell us to show less emotion, to show more emotion, to stop being ""a pussy"" as though being feminine is the worst thing anyone can be. They will tell us to ""stop being so tomboyish"", to ""stop acting like a girl"", to ""pull ourselves together"" and to ""be less standoffish"". We are told to ""be more assertive"" and to ""be less bossy"", and through it all we will never stop being told that what we are is wrong.

###We are not wrong. Not a single one of you is wrong for being who you are.

You have no obligation to look like anyone other than YOURSELF. You have no obligation to be anyone other than YOU. 

Love yourself for who you are, and keep fighting onwards for the rights to be yourself, for others like you to be themselves.

###I love you, and I want you to love you too."

With my deeply red state still clinging on to the gender roles of the past, the general consensus here is that boy should act like boys and girls should act like girls. Even with the culture of my state my friend group has been able to reject the idea of traditional masculinity. We hug, we tell each other we care about them and listen to each other when someone wants to share their emotions.

It's ridiculous that that was the first thing I considered when making an account name. I actually deleted my first account because of all the shit I was getting.

I used to think the best part about reddit was the discourse involved with sharing links and the interesting information I'd learn from the crowd-sourcing involved with reddit.

ÓÄä [Sexual assault statistics](http://www.rainn.org/statistics) show extreme frequency of sexual assault.  
ÓÄä Between [six](http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/meet-the-predators/) and [eight](http://www.oneinfourusa.org/statistics.php) percent of US men admit to have attempted or completed rape, so long as the word ""rape"" does not appear in the questionairre.  
ÓÄä Society trusts police to deal with at least the most blatant forms of sexual assault (though of course not by returning power to the survivors), even though [male law enforcement officers commit sexual assault 50% more than the general male population](http://www.copblock.org/1813/rapists-with-a-badge/) and [police families have domestic violence 2-4 times as often as American families in general](http://womenandpolicing.com/violenceFS.asp).  
  
**PATRIARCHAL SOCIALIZATION**  
ÓÄä [""Feminists don‚Äôt think all men are rapists. Rapists do""](http://dbzer0.com/blog/feminists-dont-think-all-men-are-rapists-rapists-do) because of behaviors such as rape jokes which normalize rape.  
ÓÄä [""According to a new study, people can't tell the difference between quotes from British 'lad mags' and interviews with convicted rapists. And given the choice, men are actually more likely to agree with the rapists.""](http://jezebel.com/5866602/can-you-tell-the-difference-between-a-mens-magazine-and-a-rapist)  
ÓÄä Though not all men rape, [men commit 95% of sexual violence](http://feministstudentsunited.org/2010/11/19/this-is-what-rape-culture-looks-like-an-explanation/).  
ÓÄä Many schools teach the mechanics of sex, but do not [properly explore informed consent and expressing or respecting boundaries](http://www.phillyspissed.net/sites/default/files/learning%20good%20consent2.pdf), which supports a culture of sexual assault.  
ÓÄä In the U$, R-rated films may graphically depict rape but not consensual, mutually pleasurable sex explicitly. Cinema normalizes sexual assault to young adults.  
ÓÄä And it's not like the patriarchy's porn has good consent practices either:  
(A) If a porn actress needs to stop in the middle of a sex act, she loses her paycheck, which many simply cannot afford to do  
(B) Young heterosexual men learn about sex in a culture where 99%+ of porn must be profitable or popular in a patriarchy, centered on male pleasure, primarily managed and produced and owned by males, for male viewers, available on-demand, with zero-investment, for instant gratification, without the awkwardness, hesitation, doubt, discomfort, refusal that take place in real, consensual sex relationships.  
(C) Porn videos by definition don't depict participants stopping if one party no longer feels comfortable with the sex; ""the show must go on"", the contract is binding, and it must climax. For those who this porn conditions, seeking climax can overpower consent.  
ÓÄä The dominant culture teaches **rape myths** that **falsely claim**:  
(A) ""men ought to be active and dominant and stern"", ""women ought to be passive and submissive and forgiving""  
(B) womyn ""play hard to get"" and must have sex coaxed out of them (which, beyond sexual assault, encourages male stalking, perceived entitlement to womyns' bodies, and treatment of womyn as public property)  
(C) womyn, rather than independent entities of intrinsic value worthy of respect, are mostly [investments to accrue the possibility of sex from](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2c8rl71nV1r3jsrko1_500.jpg) (since men have to ""score"", and in patriarchy ""man fucks woman...subject, verb, object"")  
(D) ""men can't control themselves"" and ""a man can only work one of his heads at a time""  
(E) womyn ""provoke men with their appearance"" and womyn ""could have resisted more if they didn't want it"" and ""if they didn't resist, it wasn't assault"" and [""a man can't rape his wife""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape#Countries_that_have_not_made_marital_rape_a_criminal_offense).

ÓÄä The patriarchy would rather advise womyn to [vomit on their attackers](http://www.examiner.com/article/1-5-women-sexually-assaulted-il-state-police-still-advise-vomit-defense) than focus on telling men how to [stop sexually assaulting](http://www.angryblackladychronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/sexual-assault-prevention-tips.jpg) women, children, and men.  
ÓÄä [""This is what rape culture looks like: a story about a video game that encourages players to rape and otherwise torture women and girls, alongside titillating images from that very game; a story about a 'girl' who had actually been murdered, alongside a photo of her looking invitingly into the camera; and a dating website. With this material like this, we learn that sex, violence, and women aren‚Äôt separate concepts.""](http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2009/02/16/this-is-what-rape-culture-looks-like/)

ÓÄä [Melissa McEwan's ""Rape Culture 101""](http://www.shakesville.com/2009/10/rape-culture-101.html) explores rape culture with **many** more specific examples, all cited and linked. Highly recommended.  

**EDIT**  
Some folks asked, basically, so what do we do?  
Here's what I do: I do consent workshops with youth, and self-defense workshops with young folks, womyn, and queer and trans people. I also help organize a youth program as much as possible run by the youth themselves, practicing a ""culture of consent"" in all interactions. The covenant they (~50+ kids per gathering, middle school age) came up with for each attendee to agree upon includes statements like **""Encourage and practice Culture of Consent. Respect that no means no!""** and **""Empower people to voice their needs.""** and **""Act as an ally: defend those who need defending.""** We combine this with decentralized, ad hoc councils for conflict resolution, based on restorative justice, to significant success. These kids are getting something I didn't have as a youth, but needed, and it makes me very proud."

I am starting to speak up more and let pro gender equality posters that they are not alone. Someone commented on a post about sexual harassment, ""this is why I am a feminist"" and they were downvoted and mocked . No one should be mocked for standing up for my future daughter and granddaughter.
Sometimes though, I feel alone. That feeling of loneliness got me thinking. I know there are other pro equality Redditors out there but maybe they are too scared or frustrated to speak up when they encounter bigotry on Reddit because they feel they are also alone.

What if there was some way for all of us to tag ourselves as pro-equality users no matter where we posted on Reddit. With Reddit Enhancement Suite I know I can tag others and mark them as friends. I am wondering if there would be a way to create an add on for Reddit that you could opt into that would allow anyone else with that add on to see you were also pro equality. I think if we had something like that we would not feel so alone and hopefully we would be even more willing to speak up when we see anti-equality comments on otherwise neutral Reddit subs.

At first I was posting this as an off my chest kind of post. But now I hope it can turn into something productive. I welcome feedback critical and supportive. Thank you for taking the time to read this post."

I first met Melissa (not her real name) in freshman biology last year. She was drop dead gorgeous. Red/brown hair, blue eyes, these cute freckles. Amazing body. We started talking after class, and found out we had a lot in common. We both loved indie music and cycling, and some other hobbies, but more important, I think we clicked. We hung out a lot, usually in a small group of friends, sometimes one-on-one. A few weeks later, she emailed me with a surprising message.

Basically, she said she was sorry if she'd been acting weird around me. She really liked me, but she wasn't ready to date anyone. She had been raped a little over a year before we met. Understandably, she had a lot of trust and intimacy issues. I told her I really liked her too, and I totally understood if she didn't want to date right then. I also asked if she had told anyone else (self-centered, I know), and she said yes, she was seeing a therapist. I told her I liked her as a person, not just as a potential girlfriend, and if she was comfortable with it, I wanted to keep hanging out. (Yes, MRA trolls, I friendzoned myself.)

We studied together. We ate together. We talked, texted, and messaged eachother practically every day. A lot of people thought we were going out. I told them we were just friends, and that was true, but we did everything a couple would do together, except for the physical side. 

One night, around midterms, she kissed me. She said her therapist was encouraging her to push her boundaries, and she felt ready. After that, we would kiss and cuddle, but never anything more. I told her it wasn't a big deal to me if we didn't have sex. I was head over heals in love, and I was happy with what we had. A couple weeks later, she asked me to go down on her. Believe me, I was only to eager. I went down on her in her dorm (private rooms FTW). She seemed nervous, but excited, and she came, then promptly kicked me out. I enjoyed a rueful fap in the bathroom.

Next time we're together, close to finals now, she asks me to go down on her again. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I asked. 
‚ÄúYeah. I'm sorry I got weird last time. It's just been a really, really long time.""
I went down on her. She came, and this time, she pulled me up and asked me to put on a condom. 
‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I asked again. ‚ÄúI don't want to rush you.‚Äù
Again, she said she was ready, she loved me, she wanted me. I took it slow, since it had been a while for both of us. She seemed into it. As soon as I sped up, though, she went stiff. ‚ÄúStop, please stop,‚Äù she whispered. I could barely hear her, but I immediately stopped. 

She was crying. She rolled over into a ball and just shook all over. I was really scared. I asked if she was ok (stupid question) and she didn't answer. She just shook.

I touched her shoulder, and asked her to please look at me. The look on her face changed my life. She looked completely terrified. ‚ÄúMelissa, it's ok.‚Äù I don't even know if she heard me. ‚ÄúIt's ok. I'm not going to hurt you.‚Äù

She was still crying, and she started whispering, ‚ÄúI'm sorry, I'm so sorry,‚Äù over and over again.

I asked if I could hold her, and she let me. I cried too, because here was this woman I loved, obviously in pain, and there was nothing I could do about it. 

Eventually, she calmed down and I walked home. We stayed friends after that, but things had changed. She never looked at me the same way, never touched me again, never kissed me. 

I felt awful. Over Christmas break, she messaged me saying she was sorry for what had happened. I finally realized what had made me feel like shit. It was her saying ‚ÄúI'm sorry.‚Äù I asked her what she meant. Sorry for not having sex with me? Sorry for getting raped? Because either one is pretty fucked up. 

She said she knew it sounded stupid, but she felt really guilty about our relationship. She shouldn't have lead me on, she felt bad for thinking she was ready when she wasn't, etc.

I tried to tell her this, and it came out mangled. I'll write it here instead: Melissa, baby, you should never apologize for who you are. I know what you've been through. I know how hard it was to let yourself get close to me, and I am so, so glad you did. You are amazing, beautiful, smart, and wonderful. I love you so much. You deserve so much better than what you've had, and I wish I could make everything better for you. And listen: It wasn't your fault. It's not your fault you were raped. It's not your fault you are still struggling with the emotional fallout. It kills me to hear you say ‚ÄúI'm sorry‚Äù for what you've been through. For what you're still going through. Please know that I love you and I want you to be happy, no matter what that means for us. 

And that, reddit, is what turned me into a feminist. This beautiful woman blames herself for what happened to her, and that is fucked up. It's time for shit to change."

Older men (ALWAYS older men) who I don't know have been telling me to smile my entire life. It's never a question. They never ask me why I'm not smiling. They don't make some kind of friendly joke or small talk that would maybe lighten the mood and elicit a nice polite response from me. It is always just an ORDER which they expect me to comply with immediately.
Today was the first time, when a man who looked like he was in his mid 30's to 40's told me to ""SMILE!"" I responded by saying ""I don't have to smile for you"" in an assertive voice and made direct eye contact.
His response was ""Why not?"" and then there was a general change in him and his group's mood to hostility and I moved a couple steps away from them to signal that the conversation was over.
Predictably I then started hearing the phrase ""ugly face"" repeated a couple times. I couldn't hear exactly what they said but I'd imagine it was something like ""If she smiled she wouldn't have such an ugly face"" or something to that effect.
I'm now praying that the bus will come quickly so I can remove myself from this situation but I continue to hear them talking about me and looking at me so I walk back and make eye contact with him. He again asks/orders me ""Why don't you just be in a good mood?""
""Because I don't have to be in a good mood. You don't know me and you're harassing me."" I also point out that he's not smiling and ask him why not. At this point the awkwardness of the situation becomes too much for him and he finally stops looking at me or talking to me until the bus comes.
So I'm on the bus and walking home and feel a weird rush of adrenaline and anger but also I'm sort of happy that I finally responded to a man even though it would have been easier to have humored him and smiled the second he told me to like a good little girl. Maybe now he'll think twice before he decides to tell a woman to smile on the street?
Has anyone else told a man they don't know that they don't want to and don't have to smile for them?
By the way I'm 24 and this has been going on since I was a child so this is a long time coming. Also it was in the daytime and there were plenty of witnesses around so I felt fairly safe. If it was dark and I felt vulnerable then that obviously would have changed my behavior. "

It occurred [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/ipbnh/i_may_have_a_son_but_ill_never_know_for_sure_the/), in a thread linking to a blog post authored by a  man that discussed the emotional ties men have to their biological (or non-biological) relationships to their children.


Inexplicably, the handful of respectfully-voiced male opinions on the matter were deleted almost immediately by the mods, including my own comments, which can be seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/mdvN3.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/5ZbtG.jpg).


The stated community goals of r/feminisms are to serve as ""the place for feminism-minded discussion, including its intersections.""


Maleness and masculinity are intersections of feminisms. They were also the explicit subject matter of the thread in question.


Further, the subreddit states that ""Everyone is welcome, but willfully exclusionary speech is not.""


I can't see anything willfully exclusionary about bringing a male perspective to the subjects of fatherhood, masculinity, and biological paternity.


Why does r/feminisms feel the need to put up a facade of inclusion, then exclude voices relevant to their discussions?


If there had been misogynist speech, or trolling, or harassment, or anything approaching exclusionary speech, I would understand the need to protect the safe space. As is, it's pretty evident that these comments were deleted simply because the mods did not agree with the opinions expressed therein.

That doesn't mean I understand what is like to be a woman, just that I understand I am in a privileged position and my life is easier because of my sex. That being said, I notice a conflict that exists between Men's Rights and feminism. And I think the problem is that the Men's Rights crowd isn't understanding the source of the problems they establish. For example, they often mention the very real problem faced by men in child custody and divorce proceedings. But they falter when they blame this problem on a matriarchal society, or some kind of reverse discrimination. The truth is that this issue is derived from a patriarchal way of thinking. Basically, women are seen as child bearers, and as the sex which makes less money, so judge are more likely to award them money and parental duties. Advocating for Men's Rights is not the correct way to fight this. Feminism is. The same goes for something like men being forced to give up their seat for women and that sort of thing. Women are seen as weak and submissive. Fix that to eliminate the problem. Likewise, female on male rape used as comedy will go away when feminism achieve its goal of leveling men and women, because aggressive women will be seen in the same light as aggressive men. So Men's Rights advocates should side with feminism if they want their concerns addressed."
