I voted against Trump and was dissapointed when he won but fucking CHRIST I am outraged when a platform designed to foster discussion and free speech works to censor people it doesn't agree with. FUCK /u/spez  #equalrightsonreddit"
1074,"Dear Reddit,

##We get it. Not everyone is ideologically aligned with /r/The_Donald, and that's okay. We just want to have a seat at the table, the same seat as everyone else, without special rules or stipulations against us. 

Our moderation team and community members have been harassed, threatened, and bullied - not only here, but also in real life. We do not encourage harassment or violence or bullying of any kind. Our subreddit rules are clear and are on our sidebar. No subreddit polices its own with such fervor as that of /r/The_Donald. (Heck, even our most loyal centipedes have been banned at some point!) 

If they come to soft quarantine us, is your community next? **We want you to know that we are also fighting for you.**

Today /u/spez [finally made an announcement](http://archive.is/vqNs1) regarding the events that transpired last week. 

Back in June when the terrorist attack happened in Orlando, Reddit Inc. decided to punish /r/The_Donald instead of /r/news, which was censoring information on where to donate blood to dying Americans. This time after /u/spez manipulated the Reddit database, Reddit Inc. again decided to punish /r/The_Donald.

We wish to point out that our community does NOT deserve to be singled out for harassment. Which rules are /r/The_Donald violating that haven't been addressed by the modteam? It appears that this ""compromise"" states that while no rules have been broken, Reddit is going to treat /r/The_Donald differently than every single other subreddit. This just brings light to the double-standard that this site continually perpetuates. 

On the heels of /u/spez's manipulation of the Reddit database last week, a leak of the secret chat logs of Reddit powermods, admins, and /u/spez was made available on the internet. 

&nbsp;

**Reddit and internet culture should not be decided in secret chat rooms in an echo chamber of an elite few.**  We fight this fight not only for ourselves, but also on behalf of everyone who is not represented in that secret chat room. 

#All we ask is for us to be treated equally. You should demand the same. #equalrightsonreddit

We were all scratching our heads as to why this occurred. Downvote bots? Algorithm cuckery? RUSSIAN HACKERS???!?!?!?

Well, we asked the admins, and this is the response we received...

####*""Hey all, we've been investigating what happened on that post. We're not seeing any bots or anything like that. It appears to be more related to the delays on vote processing.*
####*The post initially did very well in your community, as would be expected, but the title is pretty clearly antagonistic towards the ""greater reddit community"" and once it made it high up on /r/all it attracted a huge number of downvotes.*
####*The positioning was affected by the vote processing. I'd expect it to drop sharply as that catches up with the amount of downvoting happening on the post.""*

Sooooooo...yeah. All we will say is this...

#No amount of downvotes, cuckery, bots, suppression, triggering, whatever...WILL CHANGE THE FACT THAT TOMORROW DONALD J. TRUMP WILL OFFICIALLY BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!

#MAGA!"

Shame to r/news. The spirit of resistance and tenacity, combined with the intellectual scaffolding needed to realize when you are being screwed, is an excellent virtue to have for any populace, and I find your willingness to express it so greatly wonderful. Your willingness to challenge the PC status quo is a lesson all Americans, regardless of their Trump opinions, need to understand. The spirit of resistance is what made this country in the first place, and if reinvigorated through actions like this, will MakeAmericaGreatAgain.

**EDIT**: Wow! Wasn't expecting a sticky and great response! So glad many people agree with my theory. As one user pointed out, the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) could not better describe what is going on here. Censoring a group of people only boosts their resolve; it does not intimidate them. It proves to the people in the middle the victimization of the group, which encourages them to support.

Even though I am not a Trump supporter (though I do think there are very legitimate reasons people have to vote for him), I am STRONGLY against the censorship going on here. A simple way to check if a site is biased is to see if it censors media; the fact that this subreddit is (atm) being censored by preventing upvotes proves Reddit has leftism bias. A few mods banning topics on r/news is one thing, but site admins blocking upvotes on this sub is unacceptable.

**EDIT 2**: Well, voting has finally been re-enabled, took them long enough. Now in truth, it is unlikely that this will be the last of this censorship. But when this sub is censored again, the Streisand effect will kick in again, and the morale here will go up. Like the San Jose protests, it is events like this that have boosted the sympathy that outsiders like me have towards Trump and his supporters.

**EDIT 3**: Over the course of the past 5 or so hours, I went from a peak of around 6200 votes down to the current votes of 4,084. Ahh, the wonders of leftist programming."

Your actions do nothing but further prove the collective points we are all making. You continue to be willfully ignorant instead of listening to your fellow Americans...

My question to you is why? Why do you hate and think these things about us? Why do you hate Trump and his supporters? 

No. you don't have to support Trump or like us, but when you see the hate towards him and us that is so undeserved. My question to you is why? 

Tell me why without returning to your general go to defenses that I have listed above. Those are weak and ignorant. 

To all of the people who tell me I'm wrong for voting for Trump that are participating in the actions listed above. Look in the mirror... 

I am seen as a terrorist for voting for a man I believe in....

And you are the ones calling us the names.

You are the ones beating US bloody.

You are the ones yelling at your kids and telling them to get out of your house.

YOU are the ones beating up homeless black elderly women and filming it. 

YOU are the ones who hate us...

We are not the terrorists... 

Look in the mirror to see what we see. 


Edit- I know not everyone on the left is like this, I know there are some people who didn't even vote that are giving some of you guys a bad rep. Most of you guys are probably great people, this post was specifically to the ones who are out causing havoc currently. 

-The point of this was to just maybe wake a few people up, I do not feel personally attacked currently even though I have been. I see it in the news every day and I see the support and praise for it every day. I do not feel triggered, I am not crying and no I do not need tissues. I posted this because I think it is a load of shit that our media and some people in the government are saying things that condone and support this behavior and in turn support this divide between the American people- and the people who are standing up for everything that USED to be American are deemed sexist, racist, xenophobic, homophobic, islamaphobic, a bigot... Any other name you can possibly think of. If anyone shows any form of patriotism THIS is what they are labeled. 

-I am a registered independent myself and vote for the candidate I agree with most in each election(Obama last election). I posted this because I just wanted to write some of the things I was seeing/feeling down and get them out of my head.

-Thank you all so much for your kind words about this post, I did NOT expect for this to be stickied or end up on the freaking front page!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

EDIT-I POSTED THIS AND TRIED POSTING IN OTHER SUBREDDITS WITH OPPOSING VIEWS BUT THEY DO NOT ALLOW TEXT POSTS. 


again... THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR ALL OF THE SUPPORT AND LOVE... Thank you!!!

But as I see many of my more-liberal friends posting their own diagnoses ‚Äì usually blaming racism, sexism, xenophobia, etc ‚Äì I think it is prudent to throw my two cents in. You don‚Äôt have to believe me. Then again, you didn‚Äôt believe me when I said Trump would win by way of the Rust Belt a year and a half ago or when I said all of the polls were wrong. But these are minor details‚Ä¶

I want to say this as clearly as possible: **Liberals, you went too far.**

All of the polling data showed that the majority of Americans supported compassionate immigration reform. You turned around and called for a pathway to citizenship that would have shifted American electoral politics dramatically to the left for decades to come. President Barack Obama, after saying no less than 30 times that he didn‚Äôt have the legal authority to do so, decided to bypass Congress and give amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants by executive order. When a Federal judge ordered the administration to stop, they kept sending out amnesty paperwork anyway. When Kate Steinle was murdered by a five-time deported illegal immigrant in a Sanctuary City, you spoke out in favor of letting potential-killers roam the streets to further your commitment to political correctness. Instead of looking at the real pain caused by illegal immigration in this country, you went to bat for people whose first act in this country was to break our laws. **You went too far on immigration and you lost.**

Most polling data shows that a plurality of Americans support sensible ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù gun control. This election season, you defined the term ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù for the first time‚Ä¶ and it was terrifying. You chose a Presidential candidate who promised to eliminate the individual right to keep and bear arms by reversing the very Supreme Court case (Heller v DC) that affirmed that Americans have the right to own a gun. You nominated a candidate who promised to ban entire categories of weapons based not on their lethality, but on what attachments they have and what they look like. **You went too far on gun control and you lost.**

The vast majority of Americans supported the idea of revamping healthcare to make it affordable. Instead of working alongside Republicans, you jammed a healthcare bill down our throats using a parliamentary maneuver that allowed it to pass without a single Republican vote. One of your chief architects of the ACA said, on camera, that the law passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. When faced with the reality of premiums skyrocketing and health insurance companies leaving the system all together, you refused to admit that people were upset because you went too far. Instead, you nominated a candidate who argued the system was falling apart because we didn‚Äôt go far enough. **You went too far on healthcare and you lost.**

The majority of Americans support the idea of ‚Äúfree trade.‚Äù But you nominated a candidate who called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the ‚Äúgold standard of trade agreements,‚Äù a candidate who celebrated, alongside her husband, when NAFTA passed and when China entered the WTO. When Democrats had the chance to kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership last year, 14 Senate Democrats voted alongside Republicans to give the President power to negotiate on it further. Those same Democrats voted for a companion bill (Trade Adjustment Assistance Act of 2015) to set-aside billions of dollars to retrain the hundreds of thousands of Americans who would lose their jobs as a result of TPP. **You went too far on trade and you lost the entire Rust Belt as a result.**

The country was roughly split 50/50 on the issue of abortion. Donald Trump stood on a Presidential debate stage and say that yes, if elected his Supreme Court judges would overturn Roe v Wade. Four years ago, many said Romney lost the election because of his ‚Äúbinders full of women.‚Äù By any measure, Donald Trump‚Äôs statement should have lost him the election. But he only received 1% less support among women than Mitt Romney did. Why? Because right after he said he wanted to overturn Roe v Wade, his opponent declared she believes abortion should be legal up until the date of delivery, which not only terrifies me as someone who was born significantly pre-mature, but it also goes directly against the viability test set forth in Roe v Wade. **You went too far on abortion and you lost.**

Contrary to the liberal talking points coming out over the past few days, the vast majority of the country believes in equal rights for people of color. Instead of building off of this common ground, Black Lives Matter popped up and the nightly news was filled with images of African Americans rioting and burning black neighborhoods to the ground. Police Officers began getting gunned down in the streets and yet Democratic Congressmen and Senators promoted this organization from the floor of the House and Senate. Even today, after Donald Trump won the Presidency in a landslide, disgruntled African Americans are being caught on camera savagely beating White citizens, simply because they voted for Donald Trump. **You went too far on the issue of race and you lost.**

Many on the Left, throughout this election, said that Donald Trump‚Äôs message was devoid of specifics. If you were one of them, then you weren‚Äôt paying attention. Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign was completely issue-based. He won by a landslide because he isolated every single thing that the Left went too far on and promised to right the ship.

While you were salivating over the prospect of 11 million illegal aliens being given citizenship and added to the voter rolls, Donald Trump was meeting with families who had loved ones killed by illegal aliens that Barack Obama refused to deport. While you used the San Bernardino attack and the Orlando Massacre to push for more gun control, Donald Trump stood on stage and promised to keep the violent Muslim extremism that caused these attacks ‚Äúthe hell out of our country.‚Äù While you called Donald Trump the most anti-gay candidate ever, he was going off script at the Republican Convention, thanking delegates for applauding his plan to keep the LGBT community safe. He was standing on stage at a rally in Colorado holding up a gay pride flag. 

You believed that Trump‚Äôs comments about illegal aliens and certain women would spell certain defeat for the maverick billionaire. Now that the dust has settled, exit polls show Donald Trump winning 1% more of the Latino vote and only getting 1% less of the women vote than Mitt Romney did. You were wrong.

By all means, continue to post about how you think Donald Trump‚Äôs victory was caused by prevalent racism or sexism or some other -ism. That is your right and I will defend it to the death. But Hillary Clinton didn‚Äôt lose this election because of an ‚Äìism. She lost this election because the American people rejected every single part of your platform and until you realize this, you are going to keep losing.

One line that was repeated throughout the campaign when the pundits thought Trump was melting down was a Napoleonic quote: Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake. It would be easy to say this now as Clinton supporters blame everyone but themselves for this historic electoral result.

But at the end of the day, this proverb doesn‚Äôt fit because you‚Äôre not my enemy. You are my friend, my neighbor, my countryman. We voted to Make America Great Again for all Americans and I sincerely believe that you will be pleasantly surprised. "

Barely any of them have been reported on because of this bullshit Russia conspiracy theory that is swallowing the MSM. He has literally ""Done more in 97days than Obama did in 8 years."" This is not only a running list of promises he has kept so far, but also things he has done that weren't even promised on the campaign trail. MAGA. (I will be updating this as much as I can, whenever a new initiative comes to light)

Edit: Much like our AMAZING president, I have been incredibly busy for the past six months and I apologize for not staying up-to-date. I have gotten many requests to update it and finally have some extra time on my hands, so a big update with many, new YUGE promises kept will be coming soon. The last time I edited it was after his first 100 Days, and this is going to be a six month update. I also noticed that the great creator of Dilbert, Scott Adams, has linked this in one of his [most recent blog posts] (http://blog.dilbert.com/post/163600884141/the-turn-to-effective-but-we-dont-like-it) and tells his readers to share it with EVERY liberal they know, and I urge you to do the same. The cognitive dissonance is very real! It has been an incredible 6 months of only his first term, and America has already gotten much greater! (Promises preceded by an asterisk are part of the updated list and have taken place after his first 100 days)

ACTIONS NOT PROMISED ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, BUT HAVE BEEN PUT IN EFFECT:

1. (Even though it was Mike Pence) The [defunding of clinics] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/us/politics/pence-congress-family-planning-money.html) that perform abortions. Because no matter whether you are pro-choice/pro-life, the government should not be funding abortions. (Also, if people bring up the [Hyde Amendment] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment) which is supposed to not let any federal funding go towards abortions, LET THEM KNOW that US taxpayers pay for [about 24% of abortions] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2015/10/02/are-american-taxpayers-paying-for-abortion/#1e8dc3d46a4b) despite of that ""amendment"")

2. Huge spikes in the [NASDAQ average index] (http://www.infomine.com/investment/stock-markets/indexes/ndx/6-month/) and the [DOW average index] (http://money.cnn.com/data/markets/dow/) starting November 8th. (This will count for Obama unfortunately, but we know where the real credit belongs.)

In all seriousness,

Donald Trump is the only major candidate remaining who will prioritize America First. No more selling American workers out so that special interests can import cheap labor or manufacture their goods overseas to make more money for their stockholders. There's a reason that Hillary Clinton deleted the paragraph about her supporting the Trans Pacific Partnership when they released a new edition of her latest memoir... She thinks the American people are too stupid to realize she is diametrically opposed to *their* interests.

Also, Hillary Clinton approved CIA drone strikes on a non-secure blackberry, over OpenNET, while travelling abroad. She put national security and the lives of intelligence assets at risk because she believes she's above the law. She would make history if elected. She would be the first President to have to leave the room for her own intelligence briefing because she lacked a security clearance.

Trump is also the only candidate who has openly said that he would instruct his DOJ to seek an indictment against Hillary Clinton if the facts support it.

Though a billionaire, Donald Trump refused to allow special interests to finance his primary campaign. He is only interested in delivering for the American people, not the organizations that write campaign checks. He'd rather burn his own money than be beholden to those who act against the interests of the American people.

Vote Trump. Make America Great Again. Send Hillary to Prison.

**EDIT:** As to the person who gave me Gold, thank you for acknowledging how shitty this post was. But I would have rather you went out back and burned your money instead of contributing to this crooked system.

**EDIT2:** Seriously, whoever was just the second person to give me gold, I wasn't kidding. Please burn your money before donating it to the very entity we're protesting against. Rather counterintuitive.

According to the media reports the FBI under Comey was so uninterested in this case that they are not even investigating it right now. The D.C. police stonewalled any press inquiries for more information.

The press reported that police is treating this as a robbery gone wrong even though none of the high value items or cash were taken from Rich. In recent days many main stream outlets dedicated significant attention to the Seth Rich case. The Drudge Report, Fox News Channel, Hannity and many other outlets highlighted new information coming to light in this case. Reports emerged that a Federal investigator reviewed information indicating Seth Rich was in communication with Wikileaks through an intermediary. Though there is no confirmation of this from Wikileaks, the organization offered a $20k reward for information shortly after the murder, something which they have never done before. The DNC for which Seth Rich worked as a staffer also joined in and they decided to graciously offer an amount of $0 . 

The alt-left propaganda media responded with the statements  of  [Brad Bauman a professional  Democrat crisis PR consultant with the Pastorum Group.](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/763852003093217280) Of course the fact that he is a crisis PR consultant was never mentioned in any of the alt-left propaganda articles or coverage.  

Let's try to gather all the facts, (with sources) that pertain to the murder of Seth Rich, a patriot and Bernie supporter megathread style. I will update the thread as you post valuable information relating to this case.

A position he maintained ever since, showing the questions surrounding the murder of Seth Rich were considered a ""crisis"" for Democrats.  

August, 2016 Statement of Julian Assange about Seth Rich ""Our sources take risks and they become concerned when such things happen. Our sources face serious risk... [We are investigating to try to understand what happened with Seth Rich""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg).

1397,"We've heard a lot this election seasons from the mainstream media scaremongering about Trump in order to convince you to vote Hillary, and a lot of that comes from organizations who have a vested interest in keeping establishment politicians in power. This has lead a lot of Redditors to be entirely ignorant of Trump's actual ideas, drowned out in the sea of sensationalist propaganda against Trump.

So with a day before the election I've decided to compile a list of reasons I think Trump would make a good president and actually shake up Washington:

* Against the TPP treaty which threatens to destroy jobs and give more power to global corporations, while Hillary called it the ‚ÄúGold Standard‚Äù. [Source](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/28/donald-trump-vows-to-cancel-trans-pacific-partners/)

* Wants to limit U.S. hegemony via not being the world‚Äôs police. He is against nation building wars and breaks from GOP orthodoxy by wanting to be mostly non-interventionist. Hillary on the other hand has a [long record of war mongering](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/07/27/hillary-the-hawk-a-history-clinton-2016-military-intervention-libya-iraq-syria/) and [dominating in campaign donations](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/defense-industry-hillary-clinton-227336) from military/defense contractors. Everyone should [watch Trump's foreign policy speech where he sounded very presidential](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW8RqLN3Qao&t=6m20s)

* Wants to impose term limits on Congress. 75% of Americans support creating term limits on Congress, and Congress has dismal approval.  [Source](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-18/trump-proposes-term-limits-for-congress-to-drain-the-swamp)

* Ethics reform to limit lobbyism: wants to stop the link between corporate donors buying up politicians which is one of the biggest problems in our government. He has created a 5 point plan in order to achieve this, including expanding the [""definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors""](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trumps-five-point-plan-for-ethics-reform) 

* Himself is highly resistant to lobbyism and special interest influence. [He is a reluctant politician](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEPs17_AkTI), and doesn't need the donor money to get rich. He could have lived the rest of his life in extreme wealth and luxury instead of running for office, he's the only candidate ever for whom the Air Force One will be a downgrade in luxury as he currently owns a custom private 757.

* Lower taxes, while at the same time closing tax loopholes for Wall Street bankers such as carried interest. What does this mean for you? Well here is a [calculator where you can compare how much taxes you would pay under Trump and Hillary](http://www.clark.com/tax-calculator-clinton-trump)

* Knows firsthand how dishonest, biased and corrupt the mainstream media is. Just like Bernie Sanders said the AT&T/Time Warner merger must be stopped, [Trump has said he would break up such media consolidation](http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/22/media/donald-trump-att-time-warner/) putting him further to the left of Obama who allowed the Comcast/NBC merger.

* Wants to audit the Fed, just like Ron Paul did. 

* He‚Äôs very pro-2nd Amendment. Got the earliest endorsement from the NRA ever.

* While he is perfectly fine with allowing in legal immigrants, he has a strong anti illegal-immigration policy, [including de-funding sanctuary cities and going after corporations who hire illegal immigrants rather than Americans.](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/immigration) This has actually become a huge problem, with [illegal immigration costing American $113 BILLION a year](http://www.fairus.org/issues/publications/state-cost-studies). Hillary wants to FLOOD America with mass amounts of third worlders and grant illegal immigrants citizenships, as polling shows they are more likely to vote Democrat in future elections. 

* Pro-Nuclear Energy

* Goes strongly against PC culture that has unfortunately gained a stranglehold on much of our society since neo-progressivism came into vogue (Hillary is pro Black Lives Matter and believes in the Wage Gap)

* Will repeal common core

* Pro-medical marijuana, and letting states decided whether to legalize

* Anti-Globalist: He takes a strong stance against the collusion of international financiers like George Soros with Washington insiders, and wants to make national interests take precedence over the profits of huge global corporations. 

* Wants to end corporate inversion and discourage offshoring

* Understands the threat of Sharia Law and Radical Islamic Terrorism. Meanwhile Hillary holds [very regressive left views on Islam](http://thefederalist.com/2016/09/19/hillary-clinton-rather-blame-free-speech-islam-terrorism/) and defends authoritarian Islamist states like Saudi Arabia (while proclaiming to be for women's rights).

* Plans to push for 6 weeks paid maternal leave as standard and allow families to deduct from their income taxes child care expenses.

* Wants to work together with Russia in stopping Jihadi's in Syria instead of being adversaries 

* Knows NATO needs to be rejiggered to focus on terrorism instead of just continuing a Cold War with Russia and bombing countries

* Wants to end healthcare monopolies by promoting competitive bidding

* Despite the hoopla that came from the ""grab them by the pussy"" tape, Trump has been hiring women into senior positions for decades, before it was common. He actually isn't sexist and wants to see women succeed, [and nobody will tell you this more than his former female employees](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-a-champion-of-women-his-female-employees-think-so/2015/11/23/7eafac80-88da-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec_story.html)

* Knows how fucked up the Saudis are like the rest of us, while Hillary takes in millions from them

* Wants to end the incompetence and corruption at the VA


Not only that but [he has been talking about these issues for decades now](https://youtu.be/OCabT_O0YSM). Unlike career politicians like Hillary who gain their wealth from selling political favors to corporate and foreign donors, Trump is beholden to nobody. He knowingly took the risk of running for president with an anti-establishment platform which has not only put his life in danger, but put him in the crossfire to be constantly called racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic and all the other buzzwords the establishment uses to socially peer pressure to continue voting for their candidates. 

The fact that Wall Street hates Trump and love Hillary, the fact that the career politicians hate Trump, the fact that the media is almost entirely promoting Hillary and bashing Trump, should tell you everything. They have set up a system that keeps the people pacified into inaction as the wealth inequality increases every year.  Only 30% of Americans are satisfied with the current direction the country is going according to Gallup polls, we have a record 94 million Americans not in the workforce, nearly 7 in 10 Americans have less than $1,000 in savings,  young people struggle to finds jobs and America is continually slipping in most indicators of global power. While the graph of national GDP as percentage of world GDP skyrockets for China, it continually slides down for America. The establishment have enriched themselves while destroying the working class. Don't fall for their scaremongering about Trump.

1417,"Today the whole of Reddit was greeted with this [genius-level think piece.](http://i.magaimg.net/img/ytd.png)

Well here's what we have to say about that:

> Reddit's less fun when your favorite subs get filtered from r\/all, isn't it? Whether you're here for real news, the best AMA's, or some good old-fashioned memes, Reddit's at its best when you-not Reddit admins-decide what you see on r\/all. Today, The_Donald is calling on you to be the heroes we need. Please go to https://shop.donaldjtrump.com/ and show Trump how much you support him. -The_Donald Mods
 

While Reddit admins and various subs are busy creaming themselves to out-virtue-signal one another and raise awareness for *net neutrality* by professing that all data should be treated equally, we're going to call them out for the hypocrites that they are. ([rest of reddit](http://i.magaimg.net/img/yui.png))

# **\#AllDataMatters** 

So you want all data to be treated equally? Then Dear Admin, why don't you start with Reddit and practicing what you preach, instead of applying special rules that only affect one DOMreddit - You guessed it: r/The_Donald. 

Reddit has in effect become an apartheid state where Pedes are the second class citizens - simply because of our politics. They didn't want our guy to win - he did win despite all the odds and they're eternally triggered that we helped him win. I firmly believe that it is the very pinnacle of liberal hypocrisy to advocate for equal treatment of information on one hand while actively treating information unequally on the other.

Here are massa's rules that only apply to us ornery self-thinking field redditors:

* Our stickied posts are blocked from appearing on r\/all, no matter how popular they are.   
* Even posts not sticked that would organically hit r\/all are blocked if we use ANY stickies at all. 
* Other subs are allowed to direct link to our comments and posts (often to brigade), but we are forced to remove even the mention of any other sub or we face quick reprisal.
* Other subs frequently mention our mods and users by name (often to harass), but we can't even call them out to defend ourselves or our mods will be banned.

Additionally:

* We are constantly under attack from brigades and downvote bots that hit /new and have been for months. We have tried to address this with the admins and have been ignored.
* They allow dozens of barely active anti-Trump subreddits to blatantly use bots to push their agenda to the front page. Even regular [redditors are sick of it](http://i.magaimg.net/img/yuq.png)
* They allow blanket banning from other subreddits simply for posting in r/The_Donald - Even when users have never posted in those subreddits.
* They allow the open distribution of scripts advertised solely for mass tagging r/The_Donald users in RES so that they may be harassed outside of the DOMreddit, creating a ""reddit ghetto"". The thread is still up and the user who clearly violated reddit TOS has never been dealt with despite being reported to the admins.
* r/The_Donald is the only place on reddit where [4/4 = 0.99 and 13/13 = 0.98](http://i.magaimg.net/img/yur.png) We are subject to special algorithms that do not show the actual raw vote count but rather weight votes. **This does not apply to any other subreddit.**

#Make no mistake - reddit does NOT stand with net neutrality.  They actively prioritize content they agree with, and penalize content they disagree with.  Actions speak louder than words. 

---

**To our fellow pedes:**

Despite this unfair treatment meant to keep us down and hide us away, this DOMreddit has continued to grow because of all your high-energy. We thank you.

**To the larger reddit community**

Recently, we were proud to see not just a few, but all of Reddit speak out against the unfair treatment by CNN towards a fellow redditor and we hope that you will not remain silent now in the face of Reddit's unequal treatment towards this community. 

**To the Reddit Admins:**

The direct evidence of how the transactions occurred or what was given has not been fully explored. What we do know is that three governments have given to the Clinton Foundation Endowment without any specified goal. Those countries are Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the UAE. Qatar  donated to the Cinton Global Initiative with no purpose specified for the money. Beyond these countries, we know from the emails that the Clinton‚Äôs knew their foundation was at risk of being exposed.  When Chelsea Clinton was put on the board, she immediately began to sniff out the corruption. Her concerns really annoyed the Foundation Staff. She believed her parents were being duped and not complicit in the acts. They restructured the charity at the end of 2011 to hide their wrong-doings and two long-time Clinton aides founded a private company called Teneo Holdings. Which served as the legal method for the Clinton‚Äôs to continue their wrong doing. So far, I have been able to discover evidence from the Podesta emails that they colluded with the United Nations Development Programme to give $100M from the SIDS fund to GE, under the guise of a ‚Äúcontest‚Äù in 2011-2012. There is also detailed plans about using the energy-related branch of the Clinton Foundation (Clinton Climate Initiative) to create a source of income for the Clintons, especially once Hillary left the State Department and they could make deals directly with foreign governments.

**Acronyms**:

‚Ä¢	CGI ‚Äì Clinton Global Initiative

‚Ä¢	CCI ‚Äì Clinton Climate Initiative

‚Ä¢	CESC- Clinton Executive Services Corp

‚Ä¢	CF- Clinton Foundation 

‚Ä¢	CHAI - Clinton Health Access Initiative

&nbsp;

**Major Players besides the Clintons**:

‚Ä¢	Douglas Band ‚Äì long-time personal assistant to Bill Clinton. Band started his role while Bill was in office and stayed with him to help establish the Clinton Foundation. He is the creator of the Clinton Global Initiative, which allowed the Clinton‚Äôs to accept foreign aid. Band left his role at the Clinton Foundation to form the company Teneo holdings (with Declan Kelly), but retained his CF role as an ""advisor"".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Band



‚Ä¢	Declan Kelly ‚Äì A ‚Äúleading advisor‚Äù and top fundraiser to the Hillary Clinton 2008 election campaign. He was rewarded for his efforts by being appointed to the role of Economic Envoy to Northern Ireland. He would leave that position to found the Teneo Holding company with Douglas Band. Many political blogs say that his time at the state department was entirely spent travelling the country and making business connections. He is also reported to have gone to Northern Ireland after being appointed and telling the Enterprise minister that his role was ‚Äústrictly economical, and not political‚Äù. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Kelly_(businessperson)



‚Ä¢	Ira Magaziner ‚Äì A part of the Clinton Presidential administration, he worked directly with Hillary Clinton to create the failed Task Force for Health Care Reform. In 1997 he was fined for having used the money to pay for non-government employees. The fine was dismissed in court in 1999. He went to work for the Clinton Foundation after they left office, and currently serves as CEO of the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI). Additionally, (and most importantly) he is involved with CCI in their various renewable energy projects

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Magaziner

‚Ä¢	Huma Abedin - Personal aide to Hillary Clinton since 1996. Huma simultaneously as deputy chief of staff to  the Secretary of State, a paid Clinton Foundation executive, and a consultant for Teneo. A special government employee arrangement was created by Hillary Clinton to allow Huma's outside employment. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huma_Abedin#State_Department.2C_Clinton_Foundation.2C_Teneo.2C_2009.E2.80.932013

‚Ä¢	Cheryl Mills ‚Äì A long-time Clinton lawyer, and the one who defended Bill during his impeachment trial. She was Hillary Clinton‚Äôs chief of staff for her entire tenure as Secretary of State. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Mills



‚Ä¢	Ilya Aspis ‚Äì special assistant to Bill Clinton at the Clinton Foundation.

&nbsp;

**Timeline**:

‚Ä¢	Prior to 2011, the Clintons were using the charity without scrutiny for personal profit

‚Ä¢	At some point there was pressure applied to the Clinton Foundation, I did find an email where they were leaked (ahead of time) an incoming inquiry by the State Department. Unfortunately, I misplaced the link to that email, but it is in there somewhere. 

‚Ä¢	Simpson Thacher and & Bartlett (a law firm) audited the foundation to see if they had exposure; they found evidence of conflicts-of-interest

‚Ä¢	Cheryl Mills, John Podesta, and Douglas Band all worked together to restructure the Clinton Foundation in a way that would allow them to continue their practices. 


‚Ä¢	Enter Teneo. In the re-structuring document, the role of Teneo is described as a way for Bill Clinton to maintain his consulting role


‚Ä¢	In 2011, Chelsea was appointed to the Clinton Foundation board and immediately began hearing reports of corruption with Teneo

‚Ä¢	She voiced these concerns to her father and mother. They referred her to Cheryl Mills, while she worked at the state department secretary as chief counsel. 
	

‚Ä¢	In Late 2011 and 2012, Ira Magaziner spear-headed an effort to work with the UN to pay GE 100M for instituting an island energy initiative. The entire cost for the Clinton Foundation was supposedly subsidized by the UN. Additionally, Ira used the opportunity to personally enrich himself and his co-workers. 

‚Ä¢	In Ira‚Äôs energy documents he discusses how the firm has created solar parks in India and South Africa with the aid of various banking institutes. Oddly, these are not mentioned on the CCI website and there is an email where the CF staff seems to be concerned about the CF role in Gujurat‚Äôs (India) solar park. 

&nbsp;

**Companies Involved with Teneo at the very beginning who were also donors to the Clinton Foundation**:

-The Coca-Cola Company- 

-The Dow Chemical Company
 
-UBS

-The American Ireland Fund (AIF)

-The All-State Corporation

-Barclays Capital

-Indo Gold

-GEMS Education

-The Rockefeller Foundation

-Laureate International Universities

&nbsp;


**These are the companies who did not contribute to CF, but were Teneo client's at its very beginning**:


ATT 

Black Diamond 

Bank of America  

Firebird 

Liberty Mutual 

Stone Harbor

Frank Stronach 

TiVo 

UBS AG 

Mylan

&nbsp;

**The Email Proof**

&nbsp;

This is an email where they discuss the potential exposure they would have if they moved the CESC into the same office as the Clinton Foundation. This took place around the time they were attempting to restructure. When this was proposed they were still under a lease obligation. The concern about the exposure and the landlord leaking information about an empty office can be seen here:


https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/45082


>a. Do we want to move these personnel from Harlem?  Keep in mind that we risk exposure because it will mean GSA is paying for an empty 8600 squarefeet until August 2014, our first out option. We have landlords who aren‚Äôt happy we moved most of our operations out of their building and wouldn‚Äôt mind leaking an empty floor to the press.

>b.  **If we are okay with taking the exposure risk, do we envision the auditors coming back and recommending (and BC accepting) that CESC shouldnot operate within CF space even with a sub-lease agreement?**

>c.  The advantages of course are obvious ‚Äì better business continuity,
management, etc.

&nbsp;


The following email is the results of the internal audit conducting by the law firm. From the attached document, I have taken the following excerpt:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/44431

>a.	The Foundation has a Conflict-of-Interest Policy applicable to directors, officers, and key employees and a separate policy for other employees.  Publicize and conduct training to familiarize employees about these policies and/or how they are implemented.

>b.	The Foundation has a  longstanding policy regarding outside employment.  In general, the Foundation‚Äôs Code of Conduct provides that employees wishing to obtain employment outside of the Foundation must first secure the approval of their immediate supervisor, which may be granted or denied in the supervisor‚Äôs sole discretion, after consultation with the Director of Human Resources.  Publicize and conduct training to familiarize employees about these policies and/or how they are implemented.   

>c.	In general, hold regular training sessions regarding Foundation policies.  Set the tone at the top and encourage a culture where policies are understood and compliance is the norm.  

>d.	Ensure that staff is aware of reporting lines and that managers at all levels are aware of their responsibility to enforce policies.  Establish clear pathways to obtain clarification when needed in applying policies to specific situations.

>e.	Educate the Board and staff as to proper and timely disclosure of conflicts of interest.  Instruct officers and managers to educate staff as to provisions of the employee conflicts policy and how to raise conflicts with managers as conflicts arise.  

>f.	Adopt a clear gift acceptance policy and procedures to ensure that all donors are properly vetted.

>g.	Have all CGI ‚Äúcomp Memberships‚Äù vetted by CGI Management to ensure that all such Membership offers advance the interests of CGI.

&nbsp;


In response to this, Cheryl Mills proposes her restructuring to avoid potential investigations. The following has an email attachment that was drafted by Cheryl Mills. In the attachment she outlines why they need to restructure the entire foundation. Below is a direct quote from the attachment:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46634

>**Currently, the President personally compensates certain employees to perform duties that fall outside of the scope of the Foundation entities‚Äô mission.  These employees support the President‚Äôs business, personal, former president and political activity, while also providing support for Foundation activity (for which their services are billed to the Foundation**

&nbsp;

Here is where they further discuss an issue of letting CESC employees retain CESC benefits while working for the Clinton Foundation (as was done previously). They are concerned that doing so will not create the ‚Äúperception‚Äù that there is a divide between the CESC and CF.

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/38408

>HR and I had a follow up discussion and HR reminded me that CESC is currently served by the multi plan benefit network and thus would this new CESC allow it's employees currently accessing CF benefits to retain those benefits rather than force them to switch to CF. **I thought this would be legally difficult if we are trying to formalize the lines, perception and real, but you all tell me**

&nbsp;

**ENTER STAGE LEFT: TENEO AND CHELSEA**

After Teneo was created, Chelsea Clinton smelled something fishy about the whole thing and started investigating it. Here are a few of the claims she was concerned about:


https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39916


>A former MF Global employee accused former president William J. Clinton of collecting $50,000 per month through his Teneo advisory firm in the months before the brokerage careened towards its Halloween filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

>Teneo was hired by MF Global‚Äôs former CEO Jon S. Corzine to improve his image and to enhance his connections with Clinton‚Äôs political family, said the employee, who asked that his name be withheld because he feared retribution.


Why would Jon Corzine do that for Bill Clinton? Because they had been friends for a long time‚Ä¶ He served on a presidential committee for Bill Clinton and on a Department of Treasury‚Äôs borrowing committee. Take a look through the MF Global bankruptcy and the whole thing reeks:


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MF_Global




Here is another lovely quote from that same email:
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39916


> voiced serious concerns to Bari - including telling her Ilya has called Members of the House and Members of Parliament, ""on behalf of President Clinton,"" for Teneo clients (eg for Andrew Liveris and Dow who's coming this month to London), without my father's knowledge and inelegantly and ineffectually at best and at worse has now precipitating people in London making comparisons between my father and Tony Blair's profit motivations.



Chelsea voiced her concerns to her parents and they referred her to‚Ä¶ Cheryl Mills. Here is an outline of several more allegations Chelsea is concerned about:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31334

>- **today that Doug reached out to someone at Harry Walker (who represents my father on all speaking arrangements), to ask for a full list of all his speeches, how much he was paid for each speech, and told the contact person at Harry Walker that all speeches should now go through him, not Terry Krinivic (the scheduler)**

>- that Ilya physically saw/caught Justin a couple of days ago reading his bberry and loading the same spyware onto his computer that he loaded onto Bari's computer

 > - a secret service agent told Marc (my husband) that Justin had asked another secret service agent to lie about the parking pass absurdity [we > can talk about this really ridiculous anecdote offline] 

> - multiple people shared with me how upset they were at hearing how Justin referred to my father in the last week - in very derogatory ways widely sadly 

> - Oscar told my father he knows Justin reads his emails

> - **my father was told today of explicit examples at CGI of Doug/ Teneo pushing for - and receiving - free memberships - and of multiple examples of Teneo 'hustling' business at CGI - and of people now having quit at CGI**

 > - that Doug told Jon Davidson he was never going to forgive him for not reporting that Dad met with John (ie you John) on Sunday and that how could Jon forget who he really worked for 

>-  Doug told Terry Krinivic she would never work again in this town if she didn't back him up on everything

 > - **Ilya believes Hannah and Justin have taken significant sums of money from my parents personally - some in expenses - cars, etc. - and others directly*


Cheryl worked to downplay the information and collude with Band, Podesta, and the other CF staffers to solve the issue. The following explains why she did not interact herself:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/42061

>**Cheryl, Victoria told me you were not able to work out how to become covered under privilege.** As such, she recommended our meeting and call be only my father, the Board and John. My father wants it to be Bruce, John, me and him.


Band loses it after all of this speculation only against him and his company Teneo. The following are email exchanges where he has complaining about the hypocrisy, because other top CF staff also have external employers/influence:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/21496


>Justin and I already are not employees of the foundation. We are employees of cesc. But we could make it more official as advisors to it or something. Otherwise, raising money for it would be odd with no connectivity

> Ira runs chai and has been doing outside consulting all these years


> Bob harrison has a ton of goldman stock and makes decisions on gold mans engagement/role in cgi


> Valerie uses office space of a donor in chicago


> Bruce was paid by his law firm for years and may still be


> People sit on boards, for profit ones and not for profit ones


> I am sure there are many others we don't know about


Another exchange:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46430


>I have to agree. I think there WJC may have some real serious conflicts if we start to make too many rules. **It may be time to update some procedures but we can not ignore the nexus of WJC's life. **


  > Also. I signed a conflict of interest policy as a board member of cgi. On it, I wrote that my wife designs bags for cgi, and loses money doing so plus donating her time.**And that teneo represents 4 cgi sponsors, 3 of which teneo brought to cgi. Oddly, wjc does not have to sign such a document even though he is personally paid by 3 cgi sponsors, gets many expensive gifts from them, some that are at home etc**


> I could add 500 different examples of things like this and while I removed lasry bc they are all on the offense, I get the sense that they are trying to put some sort of wrong doing on me after the audit as a crutch to change things and if I don't mention things like lasry where they all have issues, I may regret it


&nbsp;

And, in the words of DJ Khaled, another one‚Ä¶

&nbsp;

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36761



> I'm also starting to worry that if this story gets out, we are screwed. Dk and I built a business. 65 people work for us who have wives and husbands and kids, they all depend on us. Our business has almost nothing to do with the clintons, the foundation or cgi in any way. The chairman of ubs could care a less about cgi. Our fund clients who we do restructuring and m and a advising the same just as bhp nor tivo do. These are real companies who we provide real advice to through very serious people. Comm head for goldman, dep press secretary to bloomberg, former head of banking, and his team, from morgan stanley for asia and latin am.

>For teneo, well before mf global, we have been discussing this. Its going to hurt teneo to have wjc on the adv bd any longer but we need come up with a reorg concept for the relationship with wjc and teneo that is lower key and handled privately and properly that we should discuss

&nbsp;

Another one:


https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46199


>I just received a call from a close friend of wjcs who said that cvc told one of the bush 43 kids that she is conducting an internal investigation of money within the foundation from cgi to the foundation. The bush kid then told someone else who then told an operative within the republican party. I have heard more and more chatter of cvc and bari talking about lots of what is going on internally to people. Not smart 

This was Podesta's reply:
>**You are perfecting your skills for understatement**

&nbsp;

In 2013, Band was still feeling very vulnerable. So he decided to write a letter about himself, send it to John Podesta, and have John Podesta send it out. The letter can be found as an attachment, but this is an excerpt from the email itself:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17376

>Thank you again for doing this, means more to me than you know. 



> Had a hard time writing this as you can imagine. I spent hours in front of a blank screen so I had some help from my teen folks. **Tried to tone it down but will let you have a look**


&nbsp;





**The Story of How Ira (and Bill Clinton) Stole His Piece of the $100M UN Pie**

This following is about the CCI (Clinton Climate Initiative):

One of the major programs involved with CCI is the island energy campaign. Where they facilitate the installation of solar energy systems on Island nations. The whole idea was supposedly drawn up by GE, according to this excerpt:

>GE has approached about jointly developing a model high-renewable island (GE has a pilot in Hawaii, where they're helping the govt figure out how to go from 0% to 60% renewables - the idea would be to apply this to select island nations in the Caribbean and Pacific). The World Bank/IFC has offered to fund. Others want to be involved as well.

The link can be found here, it is at the very bottom of the chain:
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9995

&nbsp;

Here is an excerpt on the role CF might play. Notice how it talks entirely about GE. There‚Äôs a brief mention of their willingness to work with Siemens in these emails, but the entire idea seems driven by GE:

> On a broad level, Clinton Foundation would manage the political relationship (Grenada, Maldives, Samoa, etc), and do the early-stage development work - the initial business planning, walking govt and the local utility through the economics and financing, advising through the RFP and policy process, etc.

>GE would provide the technical perspective: resource assessment, grid modelling, system design and integration, advanced renewable and smart grid technology, etc. Especially for the first few flagship islands, GE would be willing to devote significant R&D and engineering resources from GE Energy, from their Ecomagination program and from their R&D labs.


&nbsp;

From that same email chain, we have reference to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ability to reach out to Island nations and get them on board:

>Let me know if you have any thoughts on this (positive or negative). I would love to begin floating it during the APEC conference in Hawaii in mid-November. I believe Secretary Clinton will be there, as will many representatives from Pacific Island governments.

&nbsp;

It all seems like good charity work until we get to these two emails. The first shows that they will present the entire thing as a ‚Äúcontest‚Äù and use UN funds to give to GE when they ‚Äúwin‚Äù the contest:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/36510


>**The UNDP has indicated they want to support CCI, via the SIDS DOCK Island Fund. This is a $100mn fund that was established at the Copenhagen conference** ($40mn has been raised to date)

>**We are considering a new approach, to structure the initiative as a ""contest"" - challenging the private sector (ie GE, Siemens, Vestas, etc) to design an innovative island-wide renewable energy plan**. Something that takes a specific island to a specific target - say 80% or even 100% renewables (wind, solar, waste, hydro). **The ""winning"" plan would be financed via the SIDS DOCK fund**.

&nbsp;

I did not place those quotes in there, look for yourself. Beyond the collusion insinuated here to give 100m in UN funds to GE under the guise of a ‚Äúcontest‚Äù. Ira Magaziner apparently saw this as his opportunity to enrich himself and his team:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17472

>Someone should go back to WJC and confirm that he approved the Island
initiative ""as is"" including the $1 million Clinton Foundation budget
(over and above any funding from UNDP), **which budget includes a $100,000
salary for Ira (on top of his CHAI salary) and a staff of nine (despite
the fact that one of the people who works for Ira says that most of this
staff is unnecessary)** and that he agreed to split the Swedish post code
lottery funds which means that we will have to use Clinton Foundation
funds to fund our AFL-CIO/pension fund retrofit work.

&nbsp;

The more I dig, the more there is about energy. In the attachment from this email:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/28725

There is an attached plan for the ‚Äúdiesel replacement‚Äù aka the Island Initiative. This is a quote from Ira Magaziner‚Äôs 8 page document about the Island Initiative, where he discusses the conflicts of interest and turning it into a long-term profit:

> Over time, we expect to develop a sustainable business model where we can secure funds from the payback on projects at closing that will sustain our participation. If it were not for the potential conflicts of interest associated with Secretary Clinton being Secretary of State, we could form partnerships with Governments from the outset which would give us potential returns from projects that we help launch. Once she is no longer Secretary of State, we could structure this work to cover our expenses or even to provide a considerable source of long term funding for the Clinton Foundation.

&nbsp;

They apparently also worked with the National Renewable Energy Lab in Haiti? I‚Äôm not sure if this is nefarious, but it is worth asking questions about. They seemed interested in helping with Islands Initiative too. The involvement of a US branch like that seems like something Hillary would have organized not Bill:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/47744

>Another quick request. We've begun to work closely with NREL, the US Natl Renewable Energy Lab, on the island energy initiative. NREL is 
also involved in a few things in Haiti, and they have a team going down there in a few weeks. They expressed interest in meeting with someone 
from the Clinton Foundation or the President's team in order to get some background on energy, infrastructure, etc

&nbsp;

Furthermore, there is mention of the solar park work they have going on. Interestingly, the Gujurat solar park they helped established is not mentioned anywhere on the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs websites:

>> The Asian Development Bank is already partnering with us on solar park projects in India. They are keenly interested in working with us on diesel replacement opportunities. We are working with the Industrial Development Corporation and the Development Bank of South Africa on solar projects in South Africa and they both have mandates to go to other parts of Southern Africa to do renewable projects. The World Bank has a fund for projects like these.

&nbsp;


I wonder why they don't want it mentioned...

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46743


> President Clinton may want to know about this. It is an article in the London Times about the launch of the Gujarat solar park. The book put out by the Gujarat Government as well as this and other articles acknowledge our role.


&nbsp;

**FINALLY THE 2015 REACTIONS WHEN PRESS STARTS TO GET A WHIFF OF SOMETHING FOUL**

Example 1:


https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46014



>I‚Äôm sensitive to that (which is why I‚Äôm asking) but those CHAI Stats are on nearly every public listing of CF accomplishment. I‚Äôm want to make people think twice about calls for dropping grants to CF or return the money and the HIV/AIDS work hits home in a way that other stats don‚Äôt. Plus it‚Äôs international work. **I‚Äôm concerned about saying we used money to fund healthy schools (because we didn‚Äôt use the funding for that)**


They are discussing using CHAI's good deeds to deflect allegations about foreign conflicts of interest still being allowed to donate.

&nbsp;

Example 2: 

Robby Mook doesn't think the CHAI line is going to cover it. You can feel his angst through this email:

https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46877

>Should we do another convo w Maura about really beefing up their efforts? **Still feels like their plan to push accomplishments is thin. Or am I just being anxious**?

&nbsp;

Example 3:


https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46045


> **I'm hoping someone is keeping tabs on Doug Band. Quote in here is from someone who worked in Clinton Foundation.**


**THEY FIRST IMPLICATE ERIC BRAVERMAN, WHO IS EITHER MISSING OR IN FBI CUSTODY RIGHT NOW**

&nbsp;

And finally, we have the foreign governments who have donated to the foundation for no expressed purpose‚Ä¶



https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/45288


>So virtually all of these donations were to the endowment and were not for specific projects, correct? And are there examples of projects that are currently supported/funded through the endowment, or is the Foundation just building the endowment at this point (no disbursements)?

The reply to the question:

> **Qatar was for CGI . The only governments that donated to the endowment were: Saudi Arabia, Oman, and UAE**

&nbsp;

Same email:

>Sorry to be clear ‚Äì foundation stops -- means stop taking foreign gov‚Äôt money. Is that possible? **If not we‚Äôre going to be very vulnerable on that throughout and I think our opponents and some on our side will say at is unseemly for a potential U.S. President taking money from foreign governments for her private foundation.**

&nbsp;


**PLEASE TWEET/EMAIL/POST THIS TO GET EXPOSURE. WE NEED THE MEDIA AND PEOPLE IN CHARGE TO PUT PRESSURE ON THIS AND GET THE FULL STORY**

**This will be enforced because the consequences from Reddit appear very severe.** The moderator who messaged us suspended the account of one of our moderators, despite telling us that no reddit rules are broken. That probably means that non-moderator accounts were punished more harshly. The admins are very serious about wanting us to stop discussing what /r/politics removes. We will no longer be discussing it. 

-

**Do not confront those mods about it either.** When we received the message, I checked all the accounts of the admins on /r/ politics to see where the brigading was. I couldn't find anything that looked anything like a traditional brigade, but that is probably because of the popularity of those mods; they are so popular that their comments usually have so many upvotes that if there is a comment that looks completely untouched, that is probably because a brigade countered the enormous number of upvotes it had before. Even if it does not look like you are brigading, you still might be.

We will stay here and shitpost our hearts out because we have every single right that every leftist crybully has. We aren‚Äôt going anywhere until they MAKE us go somewhere. Our team has always stood up for this community and will continue to stand up for this community.
 
In light of Spez‚Äôs antics, it has become abundantly clear that we are not welcome here. GOOD. Reddit admins have reached out to us and accused us of ‚Äúfostering,‚Äù and ‚Äúencouraging,‚Äù harassment. BULLSHIT. Centipedes as a culture don‚Äôt harass anyone ‚Äì we don‚Äôt have to. Alphas don‚Äôt need to put someone else down - and every one of you glorious shitposters is an ALPHA, make no mistake.
 
###Let us be clear: We do not support ANYONE sending hateful private messages to ANYONE ELSE.
 
Here on /r/The_Donald we have a zero tolerance policy. If we find out you are engaging in harassment, doxxing, or anything of the sort **you will be banned from this community.** NO EXCEPTIONS. And we KNOW that every Alphapede here will stand by that statement. We don‚Äôt waste our energy on such nonsense. These are the tactics of little people, such as the shills from subreddit‚Äôs we can‚Äôt name that spew hate at us daily or CEO‚Äôs with nothing better to do than alter people‚Äôs comments to direct hate at innocent mods of /r/The_Donald.
 
Yet despite all of this, it has also become clear that Reddit wants us gone, and as such they continue to try to enforce unique rules on our DOMreddit and REFUSE to address entire subreddit‚Äôs dedicated to harassing and slandering us. The admins have openly told us that reddit ‚Äúleans left,‚Äù so it should come as no surprise that we find no allies here.
 
Many of you have asked us, many many times, what the plan is should the end days ever arrive and Reddit closes us down. We have a plan, Centipedes. We will never reveal that plan outside of the tiny group of people that know ‚Äì we aren‚Äôt going to reveal our strategies the way Bobama revealed his battle plans to ISIS. So, what can you, humble Centipede, do?
 
Should we be banned from Reddit, we will announce a new organizing location from our Twitter account, @thedonaldreddit.
 
Spread the word. We will not be silenced.

Chicago shut down a propose Trump rally. ANITFA was able to shut down a rally by threatening violence.

The Berkeley riots were endorsed by the City and Police Department. The mayor, as the riots were occurring, said it was great that ""hate speech"" was being shut down. No doubt a lawyer told him what a fatal error he made and thus he tried to talk it back.

But we all know the truth. The left wing is full of domestic terrorists, and they are supposed by Democrat mayors and police chiefs and even encouraged by the fake news media.

We are the good guys. We might be offensive with a joke here and there, but we use the power of free speech to get our message.

The left is using political violence to change politics.

ANITA is America's ISIS and should be treated at such.

I'm native Korean who have been living in the southern part of the peninsula for 21 years.
I want to share some recent approval(is this word appropriate?) and sentiment toward Mr. Trump and an opposite veto and negative sentiment toward Obama and Hillary here in Korea.
I've never been to any English speaking country for a single day and I learned English only through school education and private academy... hence my English is broken and poor, so please understand if there are some points you can not grasp, are some words that are inappropriate and weird.

First, before introducing what's going on in Korea now, you have to understand media environment in South Korea. Some attributes are different but in many points both media in SK and US are corrupt and unreliable. Basically, unlike those in the anglosphere, Koreans have little interest on global/diplomatic issues if they are not related to the peninsula's problem. We have tons of professional experts on the North/South issue, but very little on other global affairs(except for Far East relation/problems). This is also applied to the field of media, so almost every Korean media gather first information through the so-called mainstream media of US(+BBC). This clearly means that their biased and purposed opinion and frame are regarded as very impartial, neutral and objective.
So during the election campaign period, Korean media depicted Trump as maniac, psychopath and immoral trash. They literally demonized Trump as the ""mainstream media"" in the US did. It worked quite well for a while, but as Trump was elected many Koreans got to have doubt on this reckless bombards from our media. 'If he is so bad human being, how the hell he was able to make it? There must be economic/social/cultural issues that were usually ignored(maybe purposely) by media.' This was the most common skepticism that we had witnessing the entire campaigns and coverage on them. (+ Our media were very shocked about the result of the election, and they started to analyze how this was possible. They explained something like 'the fury and frustration of workers in the Rust Belt felt toward Democratic party' blah blah blah, but they never quit the habit of demonizing Trump for some months.)
Also, our ex-president Î∞ïÍ∑ºÌòú(Park Geun-Hye) was impeached for various felonies she committed, including engagement on state-run media. Those who gave up the role of watchdog against power now declared that they reflect on their past and will fully function as neutral, impartial, truth-seeking media.
But these turn out to be lies nowadays. Although some media have functioned quite well like they declared, many of them are just fucks. People are realizing that media are intrinsically just business seeking its own money and interest, and they will do whatever to achieve that even if it's political maneuvering or fact distortion. Reporter, which had been respected vocation through the period of strife for democratization in this country, is now despised. The fact that many people call Í∏∞Ïûê(reporter) Í∏∞Î†àÍ∏∞( Í∏∞Ïûê/reporter + Ïì∞Î†àÍ∏∞/trash) clearly shows this.

Second, Koreans now evaluate the president of our most confidential ally, the United States of America, by actual policies he/she impose and affect on real world, rather than virtual reputation/image which are so vulnerable to being manipulated and plotted by few purposed individuals. You guys may have been once heard of praises and appreciations from our president Moon on Mr. Trump's maximum pressure policies for the situation now happening in this peninsula. That is not just his own thought but typical and common thought the folks contemporarily have. 

Trump is called Ìä∏Î†•Ï†ú[Ìä∏ of Ìä∏ÎüºÌîÑ(=Trump) + Î†•Ï†ú of ÎßåÎ†•Ï†ú(=Ëê¨ÊõÜÂ∏ù, the emperor of Chinese medieval Ming dynasty] on the internet, and this is even a huge meme. There was an invasion of hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops against our country in 1592, which almost destroyed Ï°∞ÏÑ†(Joseon) dynasty, the preceding dynasty right before the Republic of Korea. Then, the Chinese emperor ÎßåÎ†•Ï†ú, who had refused to work and abandoned his sacred and important role of emperor for almost 20 years, miraculously started to come back to his office and ordered to send many regiments to Korea. He even payed his own treasures to purchase foods/supplies for the soldiers. With this aid and heroic victories made by most respected Korean general Ïù¥ÏàúÏã†(Yi Sun-Sin), Korea successfully expelled Japanese samurais from entire peninsula. After the war, a shrine worshipping the emperor ÎßåÎ†•Ï†ú as god was established, and kings and nobles visited there once a year for about next 300 years.
I heard that some enthusiastic supporters of Trump call him 'God Emperor'. This can sound hilarious to some people but for Koreans this is right.
Many politicians including former ministers(secretary in American English?) and current lawmakers(congressmen) of the ruling party is now calling for 'Mr. Trump for Nobel Peace Prize'. This was a joke in the beginning, but now it is getting consensus among folks and, I guarantee that this will lead to a organized movement in months if things are well solved.
Also, Obama's Nobel Peace Prize is now regarded as total bullshit. He made no empirical actions on peace/human rights but he was awarded. We now doubt that this entire thing was just a theater act designed by certain political powers. Plus he almost abandoned dealing with North Korean issues and justified/decorated this attitude with a non-sense word, ""Strategic Endurance."" He was once popular, respected and loved by Korean people but now he is viewed as a total hypocrite who is genius in image making and theater acting.
Here are some proofs on the internet.

These two websites are ranked in top 5 among Korean web communities, and I just randomly picked those threads with Ïò§Î∞îÎßà(Obama) keyword in one minute. They all criticize Obama and show their thanks to Mr. Trump.

Someone even claim that if Hillary got the presidency, American troops may withdraw and the whole peninsula would be communized, but I'll not introduce this opinion because this can be controversial. (If you are interested, read a lecture script revealed by WikiLeaks that Hillary mentioned she wants to keep these nuclear and unification issues remained and unchanged, for national interests of the US. Personally I feel deep anger when I first saw this, because I'm Korean. This wordings are very similar to those Globalists like Henry Kissinger use to bark.)

Anyway, Koreans are so much grateful for the actions Trump made, but it is sad that no western media cover on this phenomenon. I hope one day he get praise and respect he surely deserves on his diplomatic achievements in the States. He saved entire planet and humanity from the verge of terrible nuclear war."

#Huma 

EMAILID 45222

This is an email from Huma. In this email Huma provides notes about a private conversation between Hillary Clinton and Senator [Ron Wyden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden) 

Apr 15, 2015, at 10:06 PM, Huma Abedin wrote

>This is what I got. **He asked her not to share details of their conversation and she promised she wouldn't** but see readout below: Wyden Ready to support and to tell him what she needs and when she needs it. HRC said that it means a lot to her. 

This is the part of the email that describes what this was. Wyden also asked that this conversation be kept confidential and the first thing Huma does is emails detailed notes to Podesta and the rest of the gang. They are talking about the TAA (according to the clarification later in the chain) and the TPP trade agreement. Hillary wants Wyden to make the case.

>Wyden asked HRC when she was likely to say something ‚Äì HRC responded by saying she would try to postpone saying anything for as long as she could and try to wait for Wyden to make the case. If it doesn‚Äôt drop today then HRC will not say anything until it‚Äôs out there. HRC mentioned that turning off fast track changes the calculation. HRC just wanted Wyden to know that she was going to have a hard time being positive.. 

>Better for both of them, to wait to get out of finance before saying anything. Don‚Äôt want to be D finance members referendum. As soon as dropping a bill (outside chance could still blow up), every Democrat will walk if don‚Äôt have TPA. Wyden will not drop bill without TPA that Dems can vote for. Keep between us, but when get to finance mark, on big issues less secrecy and real enforcement. Wyden calls it smart track, not fast track, people to be able to turn the thing off. A couple people they both know and like against TPA and for TPP - national security people and economics people, largely operating under the same ideas as HRC. **Procedures are so stacked, rigged game ‚Äì HRC agrees.** **Please don't share details of this call. HRC agreed to keep private.** 

Note the clarification again later in the chain when Huma writes TPA, it is likely it was meant to be TAA.
Read the whole email chain, this is very significant. Seems like another example of Crooked Hillary's private position. What we know for certain is that Huma's role included taking notes on **confidential conversations** that Hillary Clinton had with various people. What else will come out in the forms of notes of Hillary's private conversations?

EMAILID 45381

Peter J. Kadzik, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legislative Affairs in the Department of Justice **(DOJ)**

His son is Peter J. Kadzik Junior. He goes by PJ Kadzik. He reached out to Podesta at the urging at his father to ask for a job in the Hillary Clinton campaign. He also sent his full resume to Podesta.

>**I was with my father** and Amy recently, and** they both suggested I reach out
to you**. I would love to find some time to connect and see if there may be
**an opportunity for me to help on the campaign.**

Kadzik Junior is asking a job here plain and simple. And even mentions that it was his father's idea. The same father who works in the DOJ in a top position.

From Podesta's response have now proof that Podesta was actively trying to find a job for the son of Peter Kadzik in the Hillary Clinton campaign. Something which was suggested and supported by Peter Kadzik the Top DOJ official who promised to Congress to help investigate the Clinton email case...

Here is Podesta trying to look for a job for PJ Kadzik, (the son):

>Do you need any junior help in hq or states? Peter and Amy's son.

Podesta sent the above to Jennifer Palmieri and Schake. 

Peter Kadzik from the DOJ, the same guy who was urging his own son to try to get a job with the Hillary campaign is writing letters offering help to the FBI in investigating the Clinton email case. You can't make this up folks. #KadzikMustResign #FireKadzik

John Podesta invites Peter Kadzik to a fundraiser for her daughter's election. Podesta solicits monetary donations from Peter Kadzik to her daughter's election to some school board. 

> Tony previously sent you the attached invite to a reception and fundraiser
 for our daughter Megan Rouse, who is running for School Board in Dublin,
 CA. ... this is her first time before the voters.
... **we hope you can support her candidacy, even at a modest level**, as
 she begins her career as an elected official. 

Peter Kadzik's response to the fundraiser. 

>We'll be there.
Best,
Peter & Amy

So the Kadzik family is there for the Podesta's whatever they need. To be a guest at a fundraiser to  (top DOJ official for a school board fundraiser? pretty good good get) to raise the profile of the event. The Kadzik's and the Podesta's do one favor after another for each other. And we are supposed to believe Kadzik is not informing Podesta about the current state of the investigation? When we already know he gave a ""heads up"" in the past?

This time the leak is about Bernie :

>Hope all is well. **Just a head‚Äôs up** that Markey and four Senate
 colleagues, including **Sanders, sent a letter to the DOJ and FCC** calling for
 higher scrutiny of the Charter-Time Warner deal. It‚Äôs not a surprising

 could come up on your end given Sanders‚Äô involvement. Please keep us in
the loop if it becomes an issue for you. **Happy to get you or someone on
 your team more information if need be.** Much appreciated.


Did Spahn have a mole in the DOJ, the FCC or within the involved Senators? He immediately knew that since he had information about **Bernie Sanders** he had to transmit information to John Podesta.

This email came from Andy Spahn who is the President of the Gonring, Spahn & Associates, a strategic consulting firm that specializes in government relations, issue advocacy, public relations. His partner is Jennifer Gonring.

https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/21847

(LINK ABOVE) Discussing a 2016 event:

Kristin White: Bennett Murphy gave $33,400 to our 2/11 event (CA472a) but the NFC List 2016 has him down for giving $30,900 this year. Would you mind poking around/updating?

Daniel Parrish: So it looks like he gave $33,400 but since it was a Hope event and he hadn‚Äôt maxed out in 2012, $2500 went to the debt. I can add that back in on top of his 2015 total. Does that work for you?

Lindsay Rachelefsky: Yes thank you!

Hey, that would put it in a different reporting period! But there may be something a lot worse here:

Here's how I think it works.

Someone doesn't give a max donation one year, for example 2012. The difference between what they actually donated and the maximum personal contribution allowed that year is recorded as ""debt."" So this guy ""owes"" them $2,500.

He then gives $33,400 in 2016, but they take out $2,500 to apply to the ""debt"" from 2012 and retroactively add that contribution to a year in which he didn't max out. This frees him up for another $2,500 in the current year.

Depending on how corrupt they are, they could be free to collect all the ""debt"" from multiple previous years. This could be **tens of millions of dollars** they have effectively raised their total maximum fund raising by for this election.

Someone who is in ""debt"" for not donating for the past 3 years could get in 4 times the maximum donation for this year, the very important election year.

Ex - DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's spread sheet ([""the big spreadsheet of all things"" excel file wikileaks download link](https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/?file=Big+Spreadsheet+of+All+Things&count=50)), the source of these figures (under the DEBT tab), with the two different $ columns covers the years 2013, 14, 15. We can assume many Democrats maxed out for the 2012 presidential election, but they would have ""debt"" from the less important years they may not have given as much that could be taken advantage of now.

Changes to contribution law, hidden within the 2014 spending bill, allow the DNC and RNC to take in large checks, then break them up, and distribute them between 4 funds as they see fit.

It is unknown who put this change into the spending bill. According to a certain media company, founded by someone who hosts major fundraisers for both the DNC and DWS, it totally wasn't her, according to un-named sources. (Ken Lerer, HuffPo)

This breaking up of the check is the point when the funds are free to be moved around, ostensibly to the 4 DNC funds. A crooked politician, however, could take advantage of this point in time when the money is *no longer tied to the information from the contributor*, like *what fund it was written out to* or even *what date it was from*.

Rather than go into specialty funds, the money could go to the general fund, marked as coming in from a previous year - or go into entirely different funds like Hillary's, or a fund that is used to move money around.

The national party can make unlimited transfer of funds to or from the state, local, and candidate committees. We know there was are claims about money not ending up where it should have when it came to the DNC and state parties with the HFV (confirmed by multiple members of the DNC in the leaks already)... Unlimited transactions provides an opening for software designed for large numbers of rapid speed transactions to send the money back and forth and all over the place many, many times. This would not erase the paper trail, but make it a mile long and difficult to follow. Fraudulently editing the amounts a little bit at a time could also be used and be very difficult to track.

The long periods of ""data-hygiene"" the NGP system needed to delete duplicate transactions would be a time when some these extra and suspicious transactions could be deleted, before they had to report a period to the FEC. System down for 160 hours to remove duplicates? How would a transaction even get 4+ duplicate copies? Did 4+ different people all add one check to the system and all make different typos? The FEC only needs quarterly reports, and they were keen on getting rid of the duplicates before they had to report.

(LINK ABOVE) Patrick William Hallahan is ""the director of special projects at Chopper Trading, a company that buys and sells stocks, bonds and other commodities through automation.""

-----EDIT 2: Additional information about CHOPPER TRADING. That Raj Fernando guy is Chairman and CEO of Chopper Trading too. If you don't remember, he got caught buying the board seat from Clinton (I'll post info from his wikipedia below). He gets together with Amy to **""help prepare for the eventual nominee.""** [SEE EMAIL 1150 FOR THE QUOTE](https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/1150) **This email was written in SEPTEMBER OF 2015**

From Raj Fernando's wikipedia: ""In 2011, Fernando was granted a spot on the State Department's International Security Advisory Board (ISAB) despite his lack of credentials in the subject area. He resigned shortly after, citing his need to focus on the needs of his company and to deal with unexpected and excessive volatility in the international markets. He is a well known donor to the Clinton Foundation and to the Clintons personally, so media groups have speculated on a quid-pro-quo relationship in which the Clintons helped him obtain a seat on the ISAB despite his lack of expertise in the subject.""

""In relation to the 2016 presidential election, ABC News revisited the terms of Fernando‚Äôs ISAB appointment, bringing his experience into question. According to the ISAB Charter, membership should reflect a balance of backgrounds, points of view, and demographic diversity and include a wide variety of scientific, military, diplomatic, and political backgrounds.""

""Wade Boese, Chief of Staff for the Office of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, suggested Fernando's appointment had only come at the request of Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Chief of Staff.""

You guys are pretty brave. Some of you, maybe, don't care about repercussions. Some of you, maybe, are financially independent or otherwise untouchable. Some of you, perhaps, are lucky enough to live among like-minded people and laugh at the 'cucked' cities and states from afar.

Of course, nobody will say what those incorrect assumptions were, nor quote where he advanced them: because James presented a pretty strong argument, and to engage with it would be too scary.

Not all of us are that brave. (And maybe not all of us care so much about politics that we're going to ruin our careers over it. We just vote and get back to work.)

That's why ~a third of people internally who read James' memo agreed with some, a lot, or most of it, and yet you can't seem to find any of them speaking up on campus here at HQ.

These mythical, magical, wrong-thinking conservatives, the ""real"" unicorns of Silicon Valley, the ones who shared his memo and agreed with it...where did they go???

I know where, because I'm friends with some of them. And we talked amongst ourselves about it, argued some of the facts and went and did our own research and then re-shared that research with each other in private chats. Most of these private chats ended with us agreeing with James, in-part or in-full.

**And yesterday and today at the office, I saw people who I KNOW agreed with James -- seriously, I have it in writing, these are my friends -- tell their coworkers what a shame it was that people shared ""sexist"" thoughts like those, and how they ""just wanted a diverse work environment.""**

They are lying with a grimace and nobody outside our chats knows. They blend right in.

And I don't fault them for it. They just want to get paid. They just want to be able to do their jobs without being shamed, fired, and publicly eviscerated in the media.

So please try to have a little empathy for these guys. Sure, maybe we aren't all brave martyrs for the political battles. Maybe that makes us cowards? Maybe we aren't so invested in this stuff that we'll ruin our careers for it.

But we will vote for it.

### Edit 2: Reasoning and why r/The_Donald

Since a few people have asked for the reasoning here, and don't have the time to read articles, here's a quick run-down of the ""reasoning"" of the sentencing as I understand it:

> I can explain parts of it. Apparently the normal sentencing here is 10 months. If the perp is below age 18 they normally get 1/3 of the jail time. I don't know how they did the math but apparently 1/3 of 10 is 2 according to the court.

> Also, he most likely was NOT below 18 at the time. This is what is causing much of the outrage. When he entered Sweden and gave his date of birth etc, he got a date of birth of 1998. That makes him an 18-year-old at the time of the rape, and should face 10 months.

> But during the trial, the perp found Syrian papers (a ""family book"" the articles say) saying he was born in 1999. That makes him 17 at the time of the rape. For some reason the court accepted these papers, and cut the sentence to 2 months.

> Now, why a rape of a 13-year-old would only give 10 months prison time escapes me. That they then reduce that time because of uncertain dates of birth is even worse. And why not deport anyone committing a serious crime like rape? Because Syria is dangerous, eek baba durkle.

> Bottom line here is that however the court justifies it, it's wrong. So very wrong.

And to those saying ""why did you post it on The_Donald, it just makes it seem like *fake news*"":

> Other subreddits would just downvote this to oblivion. In addition, all sources I've given in the OP are genuine, and the one from SR (Swedish Radio, state media) proves that this isn't any fake news. SR is a left-wing **very politically correct** media institution, and they would have avoided publishing this if they could.

### Edit 3: Thanks

I'll keep adding to this list as new hoaxes are revealed, but I am purposely setting the bar _very_ high regarding what constitutes a hoax being ""Confirmed"". I am using the word ""hoax"" as a catch-all for hoaxes, ""false flags"", viral misattribution of ""satire"", etc.

But I have lurked here to try to understand his supporters and his stance on the issues , especially after the revelation of the MSM's involvement with Clinton. While I don't agree with much of the rhetoric here, I have never witnessed outright ""hate speech"" or ""Doxxing"" or any of the other myriad accusations flung at this sub by the far Left.

After reading the bullshit that was Spez's ""apology"", I've subbed in protest and to support a group of redditors who, I believe, have been unfairly targeted due to their political beliefs. It's disgusting to see the CEO of a company get caught in severe ethics violations trying to frame himself as the unfortunate victim of harassment, rather than manning up and taking some responsibility. Even worse is to see the sub he himself became involved in targeted for further censorship and ""soft quarantines"".

I myself was watching the rally live in which Trump ""mocked"" the reporter happened. Trump did not reference to the reporters name, or his disability. I believe the farthest he went was mentioning who the reporter worked for, but other than that, nothing. Donald was describing (and this is important) how the reporter said one thing 10 years ago, and then is now saying something completely different, aka ""Double Talking"". Donald made an expression that I'm sure anyone else would of a double talker, flailing his arms around because said person is now acting like he doesn't remembe what he said 10 years ago. And ask yourself, would Donald, an advocate for injured veterans openly mock a disabled reporter? No. 

We all know the medias tactics. They watched the rally, and quickly thought of a way to spin what he did in a negative way. They are good at doing this type of stuff, we see it all the time. 

In fact, Donald made the exact same expression [mocking Ted Cruz](https://youtu.be/M4604reEqk0), who obviously doesn't have a physical or mental disability. He did it in the same way in which he mocks a person who doesn't have any idea of what they're saying, NOT because of their body. 

Even while watching the rally, the idea of him mocking someone hadn't even crossed my mind - I literally did believe that he was simply mocking the reporter's double talking and ""I don't remember that"" personality, which Trump did. 

This is ultimately just my opinion, but I do believe based on commen sense that he was flailing his arms to represent the reporter's double talking, not his disability. "

#ROBERT CREAMER FROM #VERITASVIDEOS GETTING ORDERS FROM DNC


EMAILID 31966

DNC staffer called ""Walker"" writes:

>subject: RE Kasich at a school in CT tomorrow

>The Kasich gun stuff is pretty bad. Adding TJ who has connects at brady campaign. **I'll link up with Creamer** and see if everytown or any other member group has something planned, and if we can get them on board for something.

This is direct proof, about DNC staffers giving orders to Robert Creamer regarding upcoming GOP campaign events. Robert Creamer as discovered by#OKeefe in the #VeritasVideos Even though the subject line says Kasich and not Trump, that is just because a staffer forgot to put in Trump initially. This is earlier in the chain:

>""Almost forgot, Trump will be in Waterbury on Saturday, also at a school. Can we have the same hits on him?""

So this chain is actually about #BirdDogging both Trump and Kasich. This following section is from the same email which directly mentions ""linking up"" with Robert Creamer:

>For Trump - Stay away from common core - no upside to engaging on that. Focus on eliminating DOE & gun stuff (include the shooting on 5th ave remark pls).

""Walker"" the author of the last email of this chain, (saying he will ""link up with Creamer"") is likely Eric Walker, deputy communications director for the DNC.

Another response signed as ""DWS"" :

>This is not optional. Please tell them I'd like a statement. This is a specific Remembrance Day. There is no such thing with Darfur and Bosnia!! **Are they kidding me?? Jews are an important constituency.** This is NOT a holiday. It's a Memorial Day for SIX MILLION JEWS KILLED DURING THE HOLOCAUST.

A quick Google of his name pulls up his Linked in profile which shows he works for Allied Barton, a security and janitorial firm. No big deal, right?  Except I remembered that the SEIU is a HUGE union that focuses on enrolling janitors into their organization so I googled ""Allied Barton SEIU"".  Then this popped up.

The last 24 hours have been disturbing, unsettling, and eye-opening. And this doesn't *just* affect the subscribers of r/the_donald - this is  a much larger issue that affects millions upon millions of users on this site. Let's recap what we have recently discovered about how this place operates.

- **The CEO of Reddit, /u/spez, has shaken confidence in the integrity of this site.** [He admitted yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/) to editing user comments behind the scenes in the database for a personal agenda. This is literally the same thing as Mark Zuckerburg taking issue with a status update of yours on Facebook and personally editing YOUR words himself to vent his frustration. *This is egregious, completely unprofessional, and potentially illegal in California.*


- **The admins participate in collusion with the ""powermods"" of Reddit in a private Slack server.** We always had suspicions of this, *but now we have proof.* (Full disclosure: The admins last night asked our mod team not to sticky these leaks.) These are moderators of default subreddits as well as other ""liked"" influential subreddits, like *[the subreddit that should not be named]*.


- **Once this leak began to circulate last night, these ""powermods"" verbally harassed and abused the whistleblower of this leak.** They also proceeded to mass ban people from communities (like /r/sports) even if users never posted in this subreddit before. (Again, we won't link to these people/events, but the screenshots of this are out there and readily accessible.)

###Something must change. And it's not /r/the_donald.
YOU have irrevocably damaged the trust of the entire Reddit community. Outside of /u/spez's paltry comments in the post he edited, there have been no official statements about this matter. 

Many prominent news outlets have reported on this story:

Despite this, Reddit for the most part has remained silent, possibly hoping this will just go away.

# This is not going to go away. 

Stop exploiting users to satisfy a small clique of admins and powermods. 

Much like how we have to unite to MAGA, we have to stand together and demand accountability from the admins."

First, because he's a Republican who might actually do the things he said he wanted to do. But second, because this is the first cultural victory the right has scored since Reagan stumbled into one in the '80s.

The left is used to losing political battles. They scream and cry over these but they don't truly panic, because they know that as long as they maintain their hammerlock on the culture, Republicans can't really change anything.

Blue Team Progressivism is a church, offering you moral superiority and a path to spiritual enlightenment. As a church it's got a lot going for it. It runs religious programming on television, all day every day. Every modern primetime program is like a left-wing Andy Griffith show, reinforcing lessons of inclusion, tolerance, feminism, and anti-racism.

Watching a 90-pound Sci-Fi heroine beat up a room full of giant evil men is as satisfying to the left as John Wayne westerns were for the right.

The Blue Church controls the HR department, so even if you don't go to church, you have to act like a loyal churchgoer in every way that matters while you're on the clock. And off the clock, on any kind of public social media platform.

Jon Stewart and John Oliver are basically TV preachers. Watching them gives the same sense of quiet superiority your grandma gets from watching The 700 Club. The messages are constantly reinforced, providing that lovely dopamine hit, like an angel's voice whispering, ""You're right, you're better, you're winning.""

Hollywood award shows are like church talent shows - the skits and jokes aren't really funny, but it's fun to look at the pretty girls, and you're all on the same team.

Red Conservativism is a business, selling a set of political products. They don't make you feel good, they don't appeal to your morality or your spiritual sense of self, but sometimes you really NEED one of their core products like security, jobs, or national defense. Their appeals to ""freedom"" and ""family values"" ring hollow these days, but when people are flying planes into buildings, you need a strong member of Conservatism, Inc. in the big chair.

And when it came down to the things that really mattered - welfare, Medicare, Social Security, and foreign policy, you knew Red Team couldn't really do anything Blue Team didn't approve of, or the Blue faithful would kick them out of office next time.

But Donald Trump didn't sign that contract. And Donald Trump didn't win by selling the same old conservative products. Donald Trump started his own religion, and he won a religious victory.

The Blue Church is panicking because they've just witnessed the birth of a new Red Religion. Not the tired old Christian cliches they defeated back in the '60s, but a new faith based on cultural identity and outright rejection of the Blue Faith.

For the first time in decades, voters explicitly rejected the Blue Church, defying hours of daily cultural programming, years of indoctrination from the schools, and dozens of explicit warnings from HR.

We've been trained since childhood to obey the pretty people on TV, but for the first time in decades, that didn't work.

Donald Trump won because flyover America wants their culture back, and Blue Team has not been rejected like that before.

The younger ones have grown up in an environment where Blue Faith assumptions cannot even be questioned, except anonymously by the bad kids on Twitter.

But now the bad kids are getting bolder, posting funny memes that make you laugh even though John Oliver would not approve, like passing crude dirty pictures under the table in Sunday School.

Meryl Streep is panicking because for the first time voters have rejected HER, and everything her faith has taught her to believe.

There is a new faith rising on the right, not an explicit religious faith like old-school Christianity, but a wicked kind of counterculture movement. We laughed at the hippies in 1968, but by 1978 they were teaching in classrooms and sitting behind school administrator desks.

Where will the hippies of 2016 be sitting after eight years of Trump? How many of the shitposting Twitter bad boys will start up alternative media outlets, until one of them becomes the new Saturday Night Live?

Sam Hyde tried it on Adult Swim, but that was just the early prototype, like Mad Magazine was for the left. There will be many others after him, and they won't be stopped by network filters. They'll come ""out of nowhere"" on the web, from the secret places that the inquisitors at Google can't shut down.

And that's what Meryl Streep is really scared of. She's not truly aware of it, just like fluttering housewives couldn't really understand the counterculture threat in 1968. But they feel that something is changing in their safe little world, and they know they have to fight it, because this threat isn't just passing pointless budget resolutions and selling pointless platitudes about family values - these guys mean business, and they're fighting on her turf.

UPDATE: Adding one thing in response to comments. Nothing against Christianity, I really wish it still had cultural power. But we can't keep wishing for it to come back or pretend it's still 1958 somewhere, not in an age when the Pope is the new spiritual leader of the progressive left. I think Christianity will come back, once the culture shifts, but the initial energy has to come from something else.

UPDATE: I think the country would be a better place if Christians were still the dominant force in our culture, but they lost the war for the hearts and souls of Americans over the past 40 years, and they need to think about why. 

My theory? I think the welfare state took over a lot of things that used to keep churches and families together. But that subject is another 1200 words."

# Dear Admins,  

-

**To understand why I'm writing this letter, you need to understand what /r/The_Donald is.** We are NOT a picture of unbiased objectivity and we're NEVER going to be the bastion of uncensored free speech that some have recently held us out to be. *We're not notable because we're pure; we're notable because we're not pure.* We did not choose to rail against the dishonor and bias that we loathe by becoming an ideal of what every group should strive to be. We chose instead to make a mockery of both the system we oppose and the ideal we've never had, by embodying such a level of hypocrisy and one-sidedness that people have come not only to accept our antics, but to cheer us on and beg for more. 

-

**We are also a community that plays with both fantasy and reality.** You've seen that we can be QUITE dedicated to spreading information and we can be about the truth in a way that you won't find anywhere else. You've also seen us photoshop Donald Trump as a smug frog or a God Emperor, or as the Napoleon of The Current Year. I'm not sure if we're drawing Trump in his 'truest form' or a fantasy of what he could be, would be, or will be but I'm also fairly certain that these images are self portraits in some sense. That's because we're a community of likeminded thinkers and we project ourselves onto the world around us, in a way that fits our group identity. 

-

**Reddit is like us in that sense of group identity.** Demographics and interests have changed somewhat, but there are a lot of similarities to when I first found my way here years ago. Despite there being 50 million redditors of extremely diverse ideologies and plenty of warring factions, I do think that there is still a way that hivemind sees itself. Like The_Donald, it has subreddits for its facts and the 'reality side' of how the userbase expresses itself and there are subreddits for the memes and the 'fantasy side' of what is important to reddit's being. I think any group will find itself with these two dynamics, though perhaps compartmentalized differently.

-

**Given who we are, this is not where reddit *should* have found itself.** Reddit found itself making the desperate turn towards a community that has never purported to have anything to do with its identity. In fact, we stand in direct opposition to what reddit stands for. So why would they come to us?

-

**I'm an expert in pissing off reddit, so let me tell you how it works.** I like to wander across reddit and see what people say about us. Most commonly, I see people who do not understand our fantasies or feel our realities. They still don't know what we mean when we say ""cuckold"" and they're not sure they even want to find out. They can't understand why we call Bernie an establishment candidate. We barely have a concept of 'racism' and we praise those who are too hard for us to allow here. We have completely alienated most redditors by encouraging ideological conformity and easily ousting anyone who dares to challenge it. I'm sure I have some subscribers who disagree, but they're afraid to say anything and I'm sure they feel like the second hand citizens that they are. This doesn't sit right with people. 

-

**Despite my best efforts, and I've tried, you admins have pissed reddit off worse than I ever could.** The forced-culture of reddit is fundamentally alien to your userbase at this point and the reason goes a lot deeper than censorship. The things that are important to your base are completely assaulted. Objective facts about the events are unbelievably important to your base and fantasies of America's Muslim Best Friends are not. Value of human life is something this website cares about and extremist PC bullshit is not. /r/News projects its fantasies and values on a website that doesn't care for them, but it's the Admins who set it up to do so. You  know how powerful your defaults are and you know what you're doing. Fuck, you even sided with them, Spez.

-

**The reason your userbase hates you so goddamn much is that you are the ones who hate them.** Just like the BernieBot who made a Trump-themed throwaway account in order to bypass our harsh ideological conformity, your average redditor either needs to hide their views or split them from multiple accounts. It has gotten to the point where MOST of your base, even those who passionately hate me and my subreddit, are second hand citizens that only use this website because there is not a popular alternative yet. You are not popular. Nobody wants to be controlled by you. As admins, you can fix this. You can affect the mods carrying out this shit, instead of scapegoating them. And for the good of your website, I hope you do. 

-

Sincerely,

Dylan-W

She died a few days ago under suspicious circumstances. Her friends on Facebook are looking for answers. Several close friends have made mentions on various FB posts that friends and family have no clear understanding of what happened to Monica except that she died on Sunday.

Earlier this year a FB friend of Monica re-shared a post by Monica where Monica linked to a blog post critical of Hillary Clinton's dealings in Haiti!! SHE WAS ONTO SOMETHING, very likely between now and then she found out about #PIZZAGATE! The linked post was: 

http://thehaitianblogger.blogspot.com/2015/03/hillary-clintons-scandalous-conduct-in.html

Search FB for Monica Petersen Haiti. This is a compilation of screenshots where I edited out other people's names but they can still be found via FB search:

See the comments - family and friends are not getting the details!
On August 2015 Monica posted on Facebook a post asking for info on sex trafficking in Haiti because she was heading there to help/investigate! Also shown in the screenshot.

Monica is also mentioned in this report:
