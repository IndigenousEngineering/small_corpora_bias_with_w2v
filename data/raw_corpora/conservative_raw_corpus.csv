1052,"EDIT: OK, the title was incorrect
I called myself a liberal. That is true, but I guess I should correct that to ""somewhat left of centre, but not very far out"". I guess I should just stick with ""these are my ideas. I have agreed with the Liberal party of Canada for most of my life, hence I call myself a liberal"". 

  I made this post because, as much as I disagree with the conservative ideology, I don't hate conservative people. And I want to show that the perception that no liberal can maintain a civilized ideological disagreement while not bashing the people who disagree with them is wrong. I do not mean to force my views on you.

1) I want to apologize for the SJWs. I disagree with their ideology entirely, and hope to keep it out of the Canadian government.

2) I do still disagree with many conservative points, but I don't hate conservatives as people. So this post doesn't mean that I am now a conservative - rather, it means that I am disillusioned with what ""liberal"" means today.

3) I hope that, even though we disagree on many topics, we can come together as a common people.

 I will not lie - I had initially hoped for a Hillary presidency. As time went on, however, I decided that I liked neither candidate. But I am going to wait and see what Trump does, instead of immediately denouncing him.

What I am for
---------------
1) Equal rights for all, regardless of skin colour, race, religion, etc.

2) Freedom of speech. Even speech which I don't like.

3) Peaceful protest.

4) Freedom of religion. But subject to restrictions to maintain human rights. Eg. I don't care if you choose to wear a cross or a bindi or a yamuka or etc. out of choice, because of your religion. But I don't think that any religion's values should be forced on nonbelievers.

What I am against
--------------------
1) Division into groups. Everyone should have equal rights. And while I think everyone should be able to be proud of their heritage, I think that, as with many other things, there is an acceptable limit. I.e., you shouldn't go around saying you are better than everyone else because of your heritage.

2) Separation and echo chambers. I have to admit, I was guilty of this. I am now trying to make amends. I think that this has happened on both sides. 

3) Forcing your views on others.

I don't know what ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" will mean in the future. I just want to apologize for SJWs and say that, even though we may disagree ideologically, I hope that we can work together in the future.

I understand that you will disagree with some, or even all, of what I said. I think that's fine. Disagreement is healthy for discourse, and as long as it remains civil, I have no problem with it.

I apologize if this comes across as posting in a sub where I shouldn't post. But I wanted to step out of the echo chamber.

EDIT: Some rebuttals: 

1) No, I am not and never will be a conservative. I don't mind conservative people, but I am not a conservative. I am for a fully secular government, I want more liberal economic policies such as stimulus packages, etc. 

2) I do not mean to say that I disagree with all of the left. I was concerned that the protestors would make me look bad. I simply wanted to point out that I do not condone violence. Peaceful protest is perfectly acceptable. 

3) As my friends have pointed out to me, the electoral college exists for a reason. While I am sad that Hillary lost (although TBH, even though I preferred her to Trump, I was beginning to be unsure), I don't want to get involved in contesting a presidential victory. 

4) I do not want a fully liberal or a fully conservative government. I want a coalition or a centrist government, to prevent extremists on either side from setting policy. 

5) I acknowledge that by listening to only a few news sources, I was not being open minded. But I think that people on both sides were doing this. 

6) I support choice. I want people to have the freedom to do whatever they want, with reasonable limits. You and I disagree on the definiton of ""reasonable"", as shown by some comments below. This includes abortion. Disagreement is fine, but I strongly value this. 

7) As others have pointed out, I cannot claim to speak for all liberals. That was a mistake.

So no, I am not, and will never will be a conservative. I know that many of you will disagree with this, which as I said earlier, is perfectly fine. That was the main point of this post, one that got lost among my inept writing. "

1662,"So I’ve only just started branching out into new subs on reddit (aside from the original ones that drew me here) and I’m actually shocked at how left-leaning things like r/politics and r/economics is. 

Now when you read the content/comments people post there is a few noticeable things:
1. Clear sense of entitlement - as in it seems a good 50-60% of posts are about somehow getting free shit from the government 
2. Everyone appears to be qualified in an economics degree? 
3. Very controversial figures even on the left seem to be praised. An absolute prime example is Alexander Ocasio-Cortez: as a non American I can see that this woman is quite borderline insane, radical, quite stupid (I don’t say that to insult, just watching interviews confirms this) and attention seeking; someone should not be allowed In office, someone I thought even the left saw as crazy. Yet on r/politics she’s hailed like a god.

I guess this has turned into a bit of a rant but the gist I get from these left leaning areas of reddit, is that the users are either:
A) Unemployed and unwilling to find work - under some impression an all providing socialist utopia will solve all their issues
B) Full time college/university students - by this I mean they’re people who trudge their way as slow as possible through a useless degree, and upon completion begin immediately studying something else, the idea being you never have to work if you’re constantly at university - this is very common where I come from, not sure about elsewhere though.

I guess what I’m asking is are my observations accurate? Do you guys feel the same? Some of these left-wing breeding grounds remind me on an old saying my Grandpa used to say to me:
“Everyone’s progressive until they grow up and get a job, then they become conservative”. 

Another final point I wanted to add is that a lot of these people give off the impression that they’re under 25/ the frontal lobe (where logic spurns from) of their brain is not yet developed. So is it possible that a reason so many younger people seem to be drawn to progressive politics is literally because they’ve yet to properly develop their brain? (I’m only 22 myself to note, so not an attack on young people)

Anyway sorry for the essay and thanks for reading if you bothered! "

Apparently all one needs to persuasively slander another person now, no matter how obviously successful and brilliant and ambitious and energetic, is to be a member of one of the privileged identity groups.  I'm a straight white male who fervently believes in God, and I am in academia... in the humanities.

I took my voter registration to the county office after work today and submitted it.  I'll be voting as a conservative from here on out.  I cannot utter a sound about it.  (That itself really makes me think.)

It's going to be a lonely walk for me, as I am a former leftie.  All my friends have become so shrieky.  At least I live in Texas.

I'm truly heartsick about how myopic I've been... until now.  This really, really opened my eyes.

I hope I'm not the only one.  I'll never vote for another D again.

&#x200B;

edit: I'm also resigning my position on a left-leaning academic editorial board.  no more.  I can't do it anymore.

edit 2: wow I got home from a football game and look at this.  thanks for the gold, kindred spirits! appreciate the warm welcome.  I'll get to the comments in due course, likely in the morning as I have grading to do.  Thanks a bunch!

edit 3: the outpouring of support is very heartening.  thank you.  that's from the heart.  *files deferently and respectfully into the back row, among the freshmen* :)"

1956,"I grew up on the left. My parents were more conservative, but I was always a stalwart supporter of progressive rights, and admired the ""Hippie left"" for peacefully protesting against the strong-handed right.

Over the years I definitely shifted to be more...middle of the aisle. At my core, I want people to be free and live their lives freely - so long as they don't harm others. I've been cautious about supporting one side or the other.

At this point, after watching the disgusting show in Washington over the last few weeks, I'm done with the left. Completely. I will not vote Democrat on any issue at this point in my life because I genuinely cannot stomach what the party has become. Victimhood, identity politics, mudslinging and character assassination. 

Professor Ford. She absolutely deserved to be listened to. She deserved to have her story heard. She deserved to have it in private like the Republican senators would have preferred. Someone on the Democratic side leaked her information and forced a public hearing for the sole purpose of rallying and whipping up more hysteria. ANYONE who voted for Kavanaugh or wants to see a man innocent until *proven* guilty is now a rape apologist. Right winged people are stalked and harassed (even more than before) in restaurants, at schools, and at home. It is revolting. 

I've attempted to remain very calm and impartial during this time. I've spent the last week arguing points of core fundamental values - due process and  innocence until proven guilty. I've linked Senator Graham's and Senator Cruz's speeches, and most recently Senator Collin's speech. When discussing the issue with a ""Non Democrat"" today this is the response I got:

>do you get your information from fox news? Because your response is basically the shit I was seeing on a plane because a republitard was watching fox news yesterday on a plane flight I took.
you're so partisan it hurts. I'm not blaming him like you think I am. I am pointing to his own fucking words and his response. I'm not even a fucking democrat. I see this country being fucking divided more and more every day and can see that this is going to cause another civil war if it fucking keeps up dividing further and further.
But go ahead and fuck right off
this guy was put forward based on 3 things alone imo. 1) he has said in the past that he doesn't believe a sitting president should be under investigation. If that doesn't have any fucking cause for concern then I don't know what does
2) he falls perfectly inline with the evangelical agenda
3) he's young enough to sit on the bench for decades

I can't stand it man. There's just no helping these people and I genuinely feel there is no hope for the Democratic party with these kind of people supporting it. This is absolutely my #walkaway moment. 

I live and work as an EMT. I have a twisted sense of humor (You have to in this line of work) but I genuinely want to help people with what I do. If I respond to your call I don't care what your race, gender, orientation or political affiliation is. I see a human that needs help, and I will help you to the best of my abilities. I try to see the humanity in people - but fuck man today, the hearing, the last week. I'm done. Call me conservative. At least I can say I'm firmly with a party that believes in fundamental American values. 

Sorry for the rant, R/conservative. I needed that off my chest. 

I'll see you in November. That's for damn sure. 


**EDIT - Thank you all for the support and very warm welcome.  I'm drinking a beer tonight in honor of Justice Kavanaugh! Cheers all!**"

1961,"For as long as I’ve cared about politics, I’ve always been on the left. It seemed like the moral choice. My concern was based around helping the downtrodden. Women, LGBTQ, the poor, minorities, non-Christians, etc. I’ve turned the corner on these issues over the past year. 

Donald Trump was the catalyst for change.

It’s not his policies or even himself that made me see from another perspective. It was how the media treated him. There were so many things one could criticize Trump on, but the media still decided to fabricate and mislead viewers. 

This lead me to start listening to conservative voices. I’ve always paid attention to them as a way to justify my own ideas. I was working off confirmation bias. They always sounded racist and bigoted in the past, but things didn’t add up once I started *trying* to understand.

An example of this is the deterioration of the black family. I always chalked it up to a history of oppression. Fair enough, but it doesn’t explain why they progressed up to the 1940s and 50s, and then plummeted into crime and fatherless families. The more social programs and state aid, the more poverty and crime.

I now question all my stances, and admit to myself that I can’t know some things. Do I believe in climate change? How would I possibly know???

It seems to me that more people are converting every day. The democrats don’t think Trump wins again in 2020. I wouldn’t be surprised if he won both the popular and electoral votes next time around. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. I just wanted to express this new clarity I’m experiencing."
