Evidence of hard ban:

http://i.imgur.com/2fumOoX.png

OPs *and comments* (newly discovered) containing slimgur links are automatically removed and can't even be approved by moderators.

imgur was created by a redditor who saw an opportunity in the market and filled it, but reddit is currently blocking slimgur from doing the same.

Edit: We're getting inconsistent results from various subreddits and testing is underway.

Edit 2: Results used to be inconsistent across subs as follows, to the best of my knowledge: slimgur links were auto-removed on all subs, but some subs could approve them, while others couldn't (hard bans). The subs with hard bans seem to have been manually picked, including KiA. Per /u/AntithesisD's update (he's a mod here) as of a few hours ago, all hard bans have been lifted. Soft bans remain in effect. Per my tests, the bans go in and out of effect. The admins may be turning the bans on and off to spread conflicting results and reactions, and thereby diffuse the protest. Feel free to submit slimgur links on subs you mod, and test whether they're auto-removed and can be approved. Here are test images, fix the URLs, obviously.

1017,"For the past several years, the administrators of reddit have been complicit in creating a site with heavily curated content. For reddit as a company, this represents the interests of their investors: they believe there is more money to be made in moving away from the website's original goal of providing a place where free-speech is encouraged and dissent is allowed. Jaded 16-25 year olds with libertarian tendencies just don't spend enough money.

But what we have in /r/news' censoring of the mass shooting in Orlando is worse. This fits the general trend of reddit providing a feel good arena for mass advertising, but has a different motive. To my knowledge, the moderating team of /r/news is not paid by reddit or any third party to curate content. They could be, but there does not seem to be public evidence.

Rather, we have people squashing truth ""for the greater good"". The moderators of /r/news believe that by censoring content that could cast a particular group in a bad light, they are doing that group and the world a service. They are afraid of a public backlash against that group in retaliation. Not only are some of the moderators of /r/news members of that greater group, but they are also afraid that a specific US presidential candidate's campaign would benefit greatly from this news, and they really do not like him.

I don't think anybody is having trouble understanding the logic behind this. These moderators believe they are acting ""for the greater good"", and that ""the ends justify the means"". They truly believe they are doing the world a service.

What they don't realize is that they are overstepping their bounds. 

It's not their place to curate content because they don't like the news when that news is framed in a neutral setting (i.e., not ""this muslim committed a mass shooting, let's round up all the muslims and get our revenge). By running such a large subreddit on such a widely used website, there is an element of trust that the moderators would not push an agenda under some guise of ""this doesn't fit one of our extremely general rules"". You expect that /r/news would probably be a good source of news: it's widely subscribed and generally quite active.

The moderators of /r/news have betrayed our trust. You could say ""well if you don't like it, don't use it"". And that is exactly what we should do. We can't remove these moderators by any normal means, and calling for their removal by the reddit administration would get us nowhere (think of the dangerous precent that would set if it happened!). The best way to deal with this problem is to make sure everyone hears it, **and to not use /r/news until change has been enacted.**"
1018,"Link for the lazy: /r/justsaynope

The idea is to not post or comment on reddit on Friday, July 10, preferably to not even browse the site. This is the minimum protest period. For an extra achievement, go through the entire three-day weekend period (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) without reddit if you can.

If every person that thought ""This will never happen!"" actually went along with it, it would happen.

If you need a reddit-like site to get you through the day or the weekend, [Voat](https://voat.co/) will probably be in service by then. [Snapzu](http://snapzu.com/) and [Hubski](https://hubski.com/) are also mentioned a lot as competent alternatives, though their UIs and feature sets are somewhat different. More alternatives are available for your consideration on /r/redditalternatives. And of course, [8chan](http://8ch.net/), though it looks and works quite different, has bandwidth to spare and can accomodate all of you many times over.

As for what July 10 means on an international site like reddit, the two most popular proposals are:

1. Everyone goes without reddit on the July 10 of their local time zone.
2. Everyone goes without reddit from 00:00 July 10 UTC until 00:00 July 11 UTC, which is from 8 PM July 9 Eastern until 8 PM July 10 Eastern, or 5 PM July 9 Pacific until 5 PM July 10 Pacific.

Discuss.

Edit: I made a countdown to 00:00 July 10 2015 UTC:

http://itsalmo.st/#noredditday2015_k8pqm

Once [the countdown](http://itsalmo.st/#noredditday2015_k8pqm) hits that timestamp, it will continue to count up from it, so you can use it to count up 24/48/72 hours, however long you want to protest. I think the whole three-day weekend period (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) would be great if you can stick to it. That would mean starting the protest when [the countdown](http://itsalmo.st/#noredditday2015_k8pqm) hits 0, and continuing for 72 hours. But even if you can't hold out for that long, do 24 hours at a minimum.

A good way to stick to the protest is to change the URL of your reddit browser bookmark (if you have one) with [the countdown](http://itsalmo.st/#noredditday2015_k8pqm). That way, every time you click on it, you will be reminded of how much longer you have to go. Other ways to resist the temptation include using site-blocking extensions or programs. [Here are some good options](http://techpp.com/2011/06/09/block-distracting-websites/), but there are many more, feel free to do your own research.

Edit 2: We are being brigaded by SJWs even moreso than usual. Be especially critical of disruptive points, and do your best to not lose your composure against provocation attempts. Feel free to report such attempts if they cross the line of personal attacks (Rule 1) or bad faith (Rule 3).

Edit 3: The post has frontpaged on /r/all.

Edit 4: Feel free to get the word out through as many channels as you can. Your options include privately messaging mods that you are on good terms with (and asking them to get the word out), tweeting with #NoRedditDay (paired with one or more of #AMAgeddon, #TheDarkening, and #RedditRevolt), posting on Facebook GamerGate group(s) you might be a member of, [as well as using any of the non-reddit channels listed here](/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3b519f/list_of_gamergate_discussion_hubs/). Feel free to propose other #GamerGate/#RedditRevolt-friendly channels via private message."

----

Great, I'll see you all at the after party on circlebroke when they make fun of me for a few hours for ""mah freedomz"" being trampled.

----

Hey guys, the former /u/mrsnakers here. 

Fairly long time user or reddit (5+ years). Moderator of a few subs, including pizza, a 43k sub and long time supporter of freedom of the internet, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and all of those things that most of us hold dear. 

**I did not participate in brigading, harassing, or spamming**. In fact, I have (had) blocked nearly all of the childish reactionary subs to the recent bannings from my front page using RES, and had blocked Fatpeoplehate and punchablefaces using RES some months ago. Nearly all of my posts have been exclusively to add to the discussions, answer and ask questions, and tell a few jokes. I'm one of those redditors who mostly avoids the front page and instead keeps my custom list of subs as my primary focus when on reddit. That changed when I got wind of the recent happenings going on and centering around the banning of the FPH subreddit and the chaos that ensued shortly after. Like many of you, I did not condone or specifically support the hate going on in the Fat People Hate subreddits (*Ahem*, moderator of pizza here...), anymore than I support any of the absolute garbage that comes out of racist subreddits or gore subreddits, but I do support their right to exist as long as they are not breaching reddit's policies of not harassing, brigading, spamming, and all of that ugly stuff that leaks outside of reddit and can end up hurting people and the site. 

When the FPH subreddit was banned I was very curious to find what the reason was - had they been purposefully shaming multiple individuals outside of reddit? or maybe that the moderators were encouraging some kind of brigading? Or maybe posting people's personal information? Only to find that there wasn't any concrete evidence of such actions being presented. Instead, simply a ""we are banning behavior, not ideas"" clause had been added to reddit's policies, and that a few other subreddits had also been banned that hadn't necessarily done anything to even breach said policy.

**That's when I started to get curious**. I subbed to KotakuInAction, undelete, uncensorship, and a handful of other subs that were keeping up with the events but in a less childish manner while downvoting the various ""DAE Pao is Hitler?"" subreddits and remade FPH shitposts that kept reaching the front page because I do not believe that the answer is to throw a tantrum - as the answer to many of these problems, to me, is simply to spread information and let people make decisions for themselves. Since this all started, I began to piece together a bit of a picture of what I believe what is happening here on reddit. I don't expect everyone to agree with me - and I definitely don't want everyone to - hivemind / groupthought is at its core dangerous to individual thought as it seeks to accumulate agreement based on numbers rather than individual decision making and that it's healthy to deal with and take in oppositional opinions even when your mind is made up.

Contrary to what I've seen most people say recently, **I do not believe the recent actions by the mods are motivated by some ""social justice warrior"" grabbing the helm of the ship, or some insidious plot to destroy reddit from the inside out for fun, or even to create a safe place just because that's what the CEO thinks is best for us - but rather very simply to monetize reddit** by dismantling most unsightly things from the front page by use of censorship. I also believe that with Ellen's [fraudulent history](https://archive.is/SKiyg) as a social media marketer and venture capitalist, her heavy debt, doing away with the [staffs ability to negotiate a raise](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao-bans-salary-negotiations/), and with one of her first accomplishments at reddit to [create an official phone app](https://archive.is/uTy5W) and her submission history, [prior to becoming CEO](https://archive.is/ZKcyL) being filled with ideas to advertise via social media, or simply [shitty attempts at doing it herself](https://archive.is/tya0T) - that it's not too far of a stretch to believe she's still geared in such a way and would be willing to alter how reddit works to control some of the content. I also believe that the banning of FPH was a test run to see how well her downvote / shadowban / community removal bots and tools were up to par and ready for action - as a way to show her clients that reddit is containable and controllable and not necessarily a totally unruly beast - the fear most investors would have about such a site, I imagine. I also believe they have plans to use such programs and techniques to force content to rise to the top and manipulate the front page - which can be seen in how quickly the front page was back to normal some 2 or so days after the mess. Basically, show you investors you can control the Streisand effect - which I believe she's done a pretty phenomenal job of illustrating - and fuck the userbase, they'll bend because there are no other viable options. The next day after the front page chaos - instead of addressing any of the concerns, she went on a webcast where she was hailed by some sacred cow worshiping interviewer as ""[the snowden of our generation](https://archive.is/lWORG)"" - a compliment she gladly took. I think it's safe to say she's not very concerned.

**Below are links to all of my most recent posts about the matter that I believe got me my shadowban.** I am going to have ask that you have faith in my honesty - that they aren't cherry picked. That these are literally every post I've made in the last week or so since the chaos started and that I cannot find any reason for my shadowban among them. Please click the ""parent"" and ""permalink"" buttons to see what I'm responding to, if you're so inclined!

* After deciding that indeed, this theory made the most sense - that reddit is being stripped down in order to make it more monetizable. [I began to repeat the idea a bit.](https://archive.is/ZhedG) Maybe this was considered spamming? I tried not to copy paste literally the exact same thing, but this was during the absolute chaos that was unfolding just hours after the news broke and the front page was filled with reactionary garbage and I felt like I needed to get the idea out quickly as everyone was immediately making into a dualistic FPH vs SJW thing (one big problem with censorship...). Doesn't seem worthy of a shadowban to me...

And that's it! Everything else is my fairly normal ol' 5+ years of me attempting to create decent comments and submissions in [tf2](https://archive.is/N29ed), [cfb](https://archive.is/uFMS1), [art](https://archive.is/jWrHJ), [circlebroke](https://archive.is/9c6wr), a few other subs and the [occasional joke](https://archive.is/biqxP) for those folks who love the front page and that one time [I asked Snoop Dogg to adopt my kittens, but he had just got some](https://archive.is/qcpLT)! 

Regardless of whether you believe my theories, what this seems to show me is that **although reddiquette states that you should not downvote people if you disagree with their opinion, if you are a moderator, or specifically the CEO - you can, however, ban people you disagree with.** They should add a little addendum to that. It's a pretty important rule change. 

I'll really miss reddit. I had a good run and a good time and I'm really not sad that I believe I lost my account for trying to spread information about what I think is actually happening to our beloved website. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. For now, this is basically my last post to reddit - and a bit of an epitaph. Rest in Peace MrSnakers.

**P.S.** I screenshotted my last comments and submissions for anyone who wants to double check me for cherry picking:

**TL;DR** 5+ year very active redditor and moderator of a 43k sub. Believe that the recent FPH banning was a testing ground for the new management to show their clients that they can control the Streisand effect to prepare reddit for monetization / investment, posted some comments explaining my position, got shadowbanned.

**EDIT** I've messaged the mods of reddit asking for any explanation for my ban. I've yet to receive any response.

Apologies if some of the links are now ""deleted"" someone was quick to report pretty much everything I posted - understandable since some of it apparently broke some subreddit rules (I thought we just had to np.reddit.com things).

Perhaps all of this is the straw that broke the camel's back. /u/chooter was one of the best employees reddit has ever had- and we as the community need to say- we've had enough.

According to a PM I received from /u/wouldjesusdoit:

I fetched a list of the 5000 most popular subreddits by subscribers and wrote a script to check if each one has closed.

Half of the top 10 subreddits have gone private
27% of the top 100 are private
21.5% of the top 200.
16.667% of the top 300. 

I'm collecting more as we speak and posting to my blog: http://david.blot.im/half-of-the-top-ten-are-private

1048,"Outside all the politics we focus on these days -- identity, social justice or otherwise -- the core of gamergate was always about corrupt ""journalism"". First concerning video games specifically, later growing into wide MSM opposition in general. 

This corrupt clique of ""journalists"" has suffered a crushing defeat. Meme magic, shitposting and leaked truth is officially more powerful than a concerted months-long effort by the MSM when swaying public opinion. 

But this thread isn't made to gloat.

The MSM will be in a bad place after tonight. They will lose influence and money. They will be directionless and blaming each other and everyone else for their massive failure. 

This means that any kind of push against the MSM and their game journo underlings will be *much more effective* in the coming months. 

So if you're tired of being called a misogynist shitlord because you want good game-play instead of good virtue-signaling, now is the perfect time to act. 

Anyone have any ideas for organizing something ? 

EDIT: MSM is Mainstream Media. "

Naturally, we're standing in solidarity with the subs currently going dark, to protest the lack of communication between mods and admins, alongside the mismanagement of Reddit. *KiA is currently staying open to discuss and document the situation.*

Subreddit mods dedicate a huge amount of time and effort in managing their communities, and we do it all for free. ^^:\^) We donate our efforts because we love these subreddits, and we want the best for them. But of course, we have superiors in the form of admins that have to ensure that the site as a whole is working as best as it can. But there's a distinct lack of communication between admins and moderators, and one that often results in undue stress for mod teams. This sort of mismanagement is detrimental to Reddit as a whole. Moderators have to depend on third-party tools (RES, Toolbox, etc.) to make sub moderation easier on them. We're not given a list of guidelines on how to run a sub aside from the general rules of Reddit, which are often misinterpreted. And sometimes, these rules only apply for certain subs, as if policy plays favorites.

This simply cannot continue, if Reddit wants to thrive.

Moderating Reddit is not an easy task. The *least* we could get is some relief in the form of better communication with admins. Assign someone to handle moderator concerns; it shouldn't be that difficult. Talk with us when we have problems, don't just ignore us or let our questions go unanswered. Help *us* so we can help *you,* dammit.

I've known enough women professionally and personally to know that for every ""pro"" there is to being a woman in the scene there's just as bad of a ""con"" as well. I don't hate feminism, and I do believe that there are issues that need to be addressed on every side of the aisle. Sorry if the title came off as me ""hating women"", but I do believe that sometimes one side is taken more seriously than the other when it comes to things like death threats or nude pictures.

EDIT 2: I also would like to say that I do not condone the possession of hairy boners if you're sending nude photographs. My forest was wild and untamed like the hair of Bob Ross and I was single at the time. I'm also lazy as fuck. Don't be like me, kiddos, if you send dick picks make sure you shave or at least trim beforehand. You never know when they'll be on the front page of reddit.
_________________________

I'm really only posting this to rant a little, and I'm not even really sure it actually belongs here, but here we go.

For reference, I am Steven Bonnell II, AKA [Destiny](https://twitter.com/Steven_Bonnell), a professional streamer on Twitch.TV from the Starcraft 2 community. I choose this online name when I was 9 years old, yes, I realize it's a stripper's name, yes, I realize it's a woman's name, yes, I've heard all of this before.

I've had my entire career pretty viciously witch-hunted by SRS in the past ([4-5 different threads linked in here...](http://i.imgur.com/6JavJnB.png), [A nice 300 comment thread that spanwed many, many, many chain e-mails to sponsors](http://i.imgur.com/rNrTbLD.png)). Admittedly, I've done some dumb things in the past, and being a relatively public figure in the SC2 and streaming community, social media has given me a great chance to share that stupidity with the world. Still, having hundreds/thousands of people spamming e-mails to every single person I've ever worked with + having a platform dedicated to gathering these people to send out mass chain e-mails (such as SRS) is pretty annoying.

Regardless, I've found success, and I'm still incredibly grateful to be doing what I'm doing.

As part of some dumb shit I've done in my past, I got into a fight with an ex-girlfriend by doing something, again, admittedly stupid (albeit private...). She decided to get on my twitter and post personal pictures of me to my entire twitter fanbase in retaliation. Only 30k some people, maybe not as much as Denzel Washington or Will Smith, but enough to proliferate the entire community that I've worked in, plus more.

Again, shit happens, and to be in a position that I'm in you have to be borderline sociopathic anyway, so it doesn't really bother me much.

Women undeniably have to deal with a lot of shitty issues in gaming, but *sometimes* I feel like, as a man, no one takes you seriously if you say you're having problems. People like Brianna or Anita talk about how they have to cancel trips because they're fearful for their lives, but people like Totalbiscuit or I receive death threats pretty frequently, too. I've had people post on 4chan and twitter that they would beat me up going to an event, and I've had people send me graphic rape depictions of my son via reddit, etc...Though I don't take online threats anywhere near as seriously as the former two because, well, I've been on the internet for a long time and I know not to take anonymous threats seriously.

There's a circlejerk subreddit called starcraftcirclejerk. I don't wanna get super tin foil hat here, but at least one of the mods, u/riskychris, posts pretty frequently to shitredditsays and has gotten into arguments with me in the past over various things related to the SRS ""mission statement"".

__________________

The problem.

**The subreddit had a custom CSS set up that posted pictures of my dick anytime someone posted my username**.

Again, this is 2015, I don't really care that pictures of my hooded warrior are floating around on the internet, but the fact that a subreddit could honestly establish this in the CSS is pretty fucked up, I think.

I'm not really sure if I'll get in trouble posting this stuff since all of the content is related to me, but here we go:

- [NSFW: Picture of what it would look like visiting a thread in the subreddit.](http://i.imgur.com/Gl637bd.png)

This is not using any special plug-in, or anything to modify the current page. It's literally just a personal photo of my dick that was leaked on twitter a long time ago. It was posted in an image form on the thread anytime /u/neodestiny was typed.

- [NSFW: You can see the picture is being hosted on reddit's servers here.](http://i.imgur.com/8TYRo1n.png)

- And here is my very own NSFW ant-eater being hosted on reddit's servers. - http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/PpCmp8H_7dpIMD5aEY9-gxdl95S6lx2Vn1lmthHhmQ8.png

- [Here's an image where you can see ""destinypenis"" under ""User Summons"".](http://i.imgur.com/HGMqUjx.png) Part of the CSS.

- [And here's a pastebin containing a dump of the CSS at the time.](http://pastebin.com/LuePUNje)

____________________________

I'm not really upset that my picture is being spread out there more. If you haven't figured it out by now, I don't really care that much, even if it is a shitty picture of my unshaven, uncut brother.

*But* I feel like if this happened to any female celeb, in gaming or otherwise, a much bigger deal would have been made out of it. People would be up in arms calling for heads to roll, the subreddit would be shut down (much like the fappening related subreddits), and I'm sure multiple Patreons would be launched because God knows nothing helps you get through genuine trauma like $5k/month USD.

But instead...nothing really happened, just a slap on the wrist telling the mods to ""take it down"".

Apparently one of the moderators was contacted and simply told to remove it from the CSS (http://i.imgur.com/IhmQDVq.png), but I guess he didn't tell the other reddit admis that he'd told him to remove it? No moderators were removed from the sub, the sub is still up and running, and it seems like nothing else really happened.

- [This is my brief conversation with one of the reddit admins.](http://i.imgur.com/t8qo8ye.png)

I guess since I'm a white guy I'm just not supposed to really care and nothing is supposed to happen?

_______________________

Again, sorry if I come off as pedantic. I'm not trying to get a subreddit shut down or people murdered in real life or anything, I just think it's a bit annoying because I'm almost certain that if I was a woman this would have been taken a bit more seriously/treated far more differently."

And as I explained here, Izzy willfully lied to cover up pedophilia. https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3l15bz/in_admitting_the_pedo_comments_were_hers_sarah/ 

There's no other way to read this; even if Sarah is somehow innocent and the whole thing was an ~ebin trole~, Izzy still lied to cover up the existence of the logs and frame GG as ""hacking into her servers"" and implanting the pedo stuff.

And Twitter staff are defending the guy from """"""harassment"""""" i.e. people calling him out on his trash.

This is important and should be pushed heavily along with the ED Twitter ban; both are pretty big. Normies might not like GG but they sure as hell don't like pedos, and they certainly wouldn't like a huge mainstream website covering up for them."

I don't believe in politics as a team sport, nor the identity politics of the extreme left. Traditional conservative mores based on Judaeo-Christian religion are no more acceptable than Sharia law. Science, reason, and critical thinking should play more of a role in how people look at and frame certain issues, and violence is an answer that only begets more violence in one form or another. 

Both sides of this culture war, battle, however you want to name it, have become exactly the things they claim to abhor. Neither side is fully deserving of the mocking monikers we give them, nor should we allow them to brand themselves as something they are not. Trying to enforce the progressive stack is racist in its own way, white person's guilt and all that. But, at least to me, it isn't nearly as bad as actual race-based nationalism. How can someone with any sort of moral compass or who claims to believe in the equality of all people take into consideration any point of view the alt-right espouses without indignation at their literal belief in racial supremacy and purity? 

Often times most of this depresses me, because it makes me question the amount of progress and the actual character of the people of our country. Growing up in an extremely diverse suburban area, racism and bigotry weren't things I ever considered to be a normal occurrence. Now, I question daily how people can still be so caught up on skin color, ethnic origin, and religious belief. It has really set back my view on what the average person truly holds in their hearts, and makes me wonder about the actual direction our society as a whole will go in.

Institutional racism has been and is still a thing. Read about how black military members returning from WW2 were literally shafted by the govt (the GI Bill) and how this lead to the creation of projects. A large portion of the hatred for govt in black communities is well deserved IMO, but violence only leads to more laws against them and the racists will use the violence to their advantage to bolster other racists and get people on the edges to turn a blind eye to their racism. 

Fighting the extremists on both sides is extremely difficult, especially when they don't have clear ""victory conditions"" and keep changing the rules of engagement. Both sides will silence dissenting thoughts and opinions with equal fervor. But the extremists fighting each other is going to pull the fabric of our society apart, thread by thread.

Money quote:

> Ms. Pao, who said she wants to stay long-term as Reddit’s CEO when a one-year interim period ends, said she has removed salary negotiations from the hiring process because studies show women don’t fare as well as men. She has brought in well-known Silicon Valley diversity consultant Freada Kapor Klein to advise the company. And she has passed on hiring candidates who don’t embrace her priority of building a gender-balanced and multiracial team. “We ask people what they think about diversity, and we did weed people out because of that,” she said."

https://medium.com/@KingFrostFive/citation-games-by-the-united-nations-cyberviolence-e8bb1336c8d1

It gets into just a few key issues and keeps focus on it. Four points, one after the other, a small serious note of how much the UN cites itself, and the most entertaining botch. If nothing else I'd give it a read because it's way too ridiculous to not enjoy. The UN functions at a sub high school level on citations. 

If you're really interested beyond that, you can check the second: It gets into all 120, one at a time. A lot longer, a lot harder, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you have that kind of time or really want to check on something, like how many times The Guardian or APC or genderit.org get mentioned. I briefly got into how much they cite themselves in the short piece but if you want the longer version, it's all there. Really, the first alone can satisfy most answers and highlights a lot of serious problems and is super easy to digest. The second goes into much more and gets dull at times. Probably the most unique aspect of it is that *everything* is archived save for the PDFs, that I just have saved locally, and that includes a few that weren't linked or had broken links (it's word wrap that killed a lot of them). 

There's some parts that may be a bit more subjective but a lot of it's just neutrally weeding things out. Something is cited repeatedly? Out. Something that doesn't make any sense in citation (not due to ""I don't like this,"" but because ""this cannot belong to that other reference"")? Out. Gets down to 64% are valid. All I ask is that you don't go into the second blindly. It's not as fun, is a lot more boring, but has a lot more detail.

1186,"For months now you've seen it here and there. ""Hategroup GamerGate uses excuse of ethical gaming journalism to harass women out of gaming."" *""Whatever""*, you think. Sure, gaming journalism sucks, but that seems like a mess, so I'm not getting involved. Or maybe you don't think gaming journalism is relevant anymore, and your solution is to just not go to any of these sites. Why raise a fuss? Or maybe you thought it was a cause worth getting invested in, but too many bad eggs in the bunch ruined it. Why care? Why put forth the effort? It'll die down. It's the internet. 

Now you've seen why it does matter. As many people on KotakuInAction have learned, this goes far beyond gaming journalism. Some people will argue that GamerGate is only just about that, and this attached culture war is only connected in small ways. However, as GamerGate drew on and on, we saw first hand just how far this network spreads. It woke many of us up. I never liked the term ""taking the red pill"" because it seemed to make it more dramatic than it really seemed, but after being exposed to everything, that's exactly what it is. There's a moment in this mess where suddenly, all those more outlandish claims became true, and even went beyond what people said. Many times, truth was stranger than fiction. 

Our opposition is corrupt. They are liars. They are opportunists. They have power. They are privileged. They take up the banner of ""Social Justice"" and make the people who don't have power, believe they are in the situation they're in because of their race, their gender, or their sexual identity. That have them believe that there's a systematic problem that's woven into our very culture that stops them from ever being successful, no matter how hard they might try. So why bother? Instead, take up arms. Become an army. Become their tool. 

You thought GamerGate might not effect you. You still play good games. You still have fun. Sure, some games might be shit, and launches fucked up, but there's still those gems out there you love. But this isn't just about video games. And you see it now. You see the tip of the ice berg and you're starting to make all the connections. You might have been surprised at first, finding your way to KotakuInAction, thinking *""Why was a thread on 'all'? Why are a bunch of gators talking about this?""* Then you looked around. You didn't see any harassment. You didn't see any women being targeted. You saw discussions. Debate. Concerns. You saw threads talking about censorship, ethics, science fiction and fantasy books. 

KotakuInAction's days are numbered. This new policy of banning subreddits due to what they consider harassment was the perfect excuse to push it on its way out. GamerGate has been labeled as misogynist harassers from the start, and that label extends to KotakuInAction, even though there's never been any proof of this. Do you want to see how easy it is to label this group as harassers? 

Brianna Wu is a self proclaimed ""target"" of GamerGate. She spent months trying to instigate GamerGate on [Twitter by posting trolling comments and images.](https://archive.is/NCLXB) Then, in October, she finally got GamerGate to take the bait. She used a meme generator to poke fun at GamerGate, and several users on 8chan's /gg/ board did what they do best. Shitpost. They flooded the meme generator with trolling comments, much in the vein of Wu's originals. Some went too far, but most of them were shit posts. /gg/ was talking about this on their board. 

Then, right in the middle of discussing her reactions to the memes, someone, without being asked, posts personal information about Brianna Wu. They board instantly reported the post, as it is against that board's rules to dox or harass anyone, and it was removed quickly. No one asked for it, no one celebrated its release, and many people called out the post. Within minutes, Wu had a screenshot on her twitter blaming the entire board, and all of GamerGate for doxing her. This was clearly the action of one person, acting against the board's own rules, without anyone asking for the information, and yet she somehow was stil able to blame the entire board, and all of GamerGate for it. Shortly after she tweeted that her personal information was released, she received death threats by a newly created Twitter account, that mentioned some of the personal information. 

The following weekend she was on National television labeling GamerGate and 8chan as a hategroup. Claiming that they were trying to drive her out of gaming and that she was a target of a hategroup. Many within GamerGate believe she posted her own information, and even made the Twitter account and sent herself the threats. None of that matters. There's not even an ounce of evidence to support any of that, but at the same time there's not an ounce of evidence to support it being the intent of GamerGate for these actions. However, she was able to smear an entire group of people for the actions of one, possible two, people. No one in the media questioned her accounts. They broadcasted her side of the story, and other media outlets copied what they said, and published their own stories. GamerGate had reached some main stream media before this event, but this is the moment when the reach spread far and wide, and even main stream media outlets had GamerGate pegged as a hate group. 

I have found the [archived thread where her dox was posted](http://archive.is/5xlts), so you can see for yourself what happened. You'll notice the post containing the dox was removed, because it was deleted within a few minutes (but not before [Wu made her Twitter post blaming them](https://archive.is/gslaL)), but here's a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/MeyVACc.jpg) of it. You can see exactly where it fit into the thread, and how the thread reacted to it. 

So now you see how easy it can be to paint a subreddit as a harassment/hate group. All you need is one account, one person, to post something against the board's rules. Reddit claims they will only delete subreddits where their moderators aren't doing what they can to stop these sort of posts, but /gg/ did a good job of stamping out calls to harassment and doxes, yet that didn't stop them getting smeared on national TV, which is  used in Wikipedia as a source to prove GamerGate's a hategroup. KotakuInAction is already known to some as a hub for a hategroup, and even though Reddit hasn't banned it yet, it's leading up to it. 

So now you see why this matters. Now you see why we've been at this for months. Now you see how this effects you. What's to stop your favorite subreddit from being next? Some claim the simple solution is to migrate to other sites, but that's already been done before. Places that were thought to be bastions of free speech slowly turned into this exact scenario. A stand has to be made. This isn't about whether or not 'fatpeoplehate' was worth deleting. Some will say it was, some will say it wasn't. The problem is how easy this new policy will be for them to abuse. This isn't about stopping hate, this is about shutting us up. Chairman Pao has come up a lot in this subreddit, because her actions and scams have directly related to our interests and discussions. The stories uncovered leaked into 'all' on more than one occasion. And every time it did, our numbers bumped. KotakuInAction is becoming more and more active, with more and more people discovering just how far this goes, and just how it affects them. Often times, they find out before it's too late, and they've already been silenced. Even now, I fear how little exposure this thread will get, due to the on and off vote-locking that seems to be undergoing. 

Spread this message. Show people how this relates to them. We can't afford to ignore this festering wound any longer. It will just spread. We need to expose people to this information as much as we can, and call out these actions and show those in power they can't get away with it. If we go quietly, they'll win and it will be easier to bury this all and in months time it will be forgotten. The more this gets exposed, the more people know, the less influence they will have. 

**Edit:** While I know you can't make everyone happy, at this point in time, a good 10% of the votes have been downvotes. I tagged this Discussion for a reason. I would be more than happy to hear what you have to say if you don't agree with what I've said. While I have a busy day ahead, I would love to talk with you, and will respond to anyone who disagrees with this. 

**tl;dr:** To quote /u/AlexHD's version of an old poem:

>First they came for the Gamergaters, and I did not speak out— 

>Because I was not a Gamergater.

>Then they came for the fat haters, and I did not speak out—

>Because I was not a fat hater.

>Then they came for the Reddit users, and I did not speak out—

>Because I was not a Reddit user.

**So what media response did this totally serious study gather? Surely it was mockery or at the very least it was ignored right?**

[The games industry is wrong about kids, gaming and gender](https://archive.is/Js3A6) (by Charlie Hall at **Polygon**)

>The results of a new study, revealed yesterday at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, show that today's young consumers are far more progressive than the games industry gives them credit for.
>To ignore this study, say its authors, will inevitably lead the games industry astray. They conclude that by ignoring young people's appetite for strong, dignified, self-possessed female protagonists, game developers will not merely alienate a growing audience, they will leave money on the table.

[Inside the research that could change the perception of kids, gaming and gender](https://archive.is/cqCoP) (by Charlie Hall at **Polygon**)

>The survey was distributed widely, to professional contacts of Wiseman’s as well as teachers in schools around the country. Before long, entire classrooms and even whole grade levels were responding. The online survey reached sixth graders in Massachusetts and Alabama, and clear across the country it was taken by juniors in California and Arizona.
>Before it was over, the team had received more than 1,400 responses from more than 11 different states. The results, shown here and available online at the GDC Vault, were extraordinary.

[Everything You Know About Boys and Video Games Is Wrong](https://archive.is/NYnsK) (by Rosalinde Wiseman at **Time**)

>Boys believe female characters are treated too often as sex objects
47% of middle school boys agreed or strongly agreed, and 61% of high school boys agreed or strongly agreed. “If women are objectified like this it defeats the entire purpose of fighting,” Theo, an eighth-grader who loves playing Mortal Kombat, told us. “I would respect the [female] character more for having some dignity.”

[Even teenage boys are sick of sexist video games, survey finds](https://archive.is/m56iv) (by Keith Stuart at **The Guardian**)

>Many teenage boys are tired of the sexualised depiction of women in video games, according to the findings of a new survey.

[Survey Shows Even Teenage Boys Think Women Are Over-Sexualized in Video Games](https://archive.is/WOmWF) (by Dan Van Winkle at **The Mary Sue**)

>Dubious game developers and Twitter trolls will now have to look elsewhere for backup when it comes to telling us “SJWs” that there’s nothing wrong with the portrayal of women in video games. A survey found that most teenage boys—despite common wisdom to the contrary—don’t want women to be over-sexualized in their video games.
I’ll let you take a minute to readjust your entire worldview.

Mrs. Wiseman says in her GDC talk:

>I really went around the country to all different kinds of schools and said: ""Please, have your students fill this out"". [...] **We had 1.853 that filled out the survey and 1.400 of those approximately were between the 6th and 12th grade, between age 11 and 18.**

So over 21% of the respondents were of the wrong age and admitted it. How many were of the wrong age but lied so their responses would get through?

**Summary: The survey has been carried out in such a way that invalidates it as a whole. By soliciting responses online and publishing the survey URL the authors mixed responses from school kids with responses from adults who follow the authors on social media and who wanted the survey to result in a certain way.**

The authors also used leading questions in the survey, questions that nudge the respondent a certain way. For example ""Are Females Too Often Treated as Sex Objects?"".

This is the war against gamers now, it's not from the conservative right anymore, but all moral panickers have shared one common trait, they don't care in the least about games and gamer culture, except to use it for their own poltical agenda.

Man, this is a proper mess. So 3 black students at Oberlin were caught trying to shoplift at a bakery that's been around for a 100 years. They punched and kicked the shopkeeper after the accusations and were arrested for doing so and cried that they had been racially profiled and the owners were racist. This was in November 2016. 

After which Oberlins staff and students seem to have gone insane. They demonstrated outside the bakery, the student senate claimed the bakery had a history of racial profiling and they continue to boycott the store even after the shoplifters ""pleaded guilty in August to attempted theft and aggravated trespassing and said in statements required by a plea agreement that their actions were wrong and that the store wasn't racist.""

So now the bakery is suing Oberlin and Meredith Raimondo,  the vice president and dean of students. They accuse Raimondo of taking part in the demonstration against Gibson's with a bullhorn and distributed a flyer that said the bakery is a ""RACIST establishment with a LONG ACCOUNT of RACIAL PROFILING and DISCRIMINATION."" They also claim that college tour guides still inform prospective students that the bakery is staffed by racists. 

The BEST part is that one of the Oberlin seniors is pulling a boogie and saying 'hey guys, both sides are equally bad, we should communicate'. To quote the senior ""Gibson's has become all that is wrong with America. It's a classic case of those political bubbles that don't communicate with each other, and don't want to.""

Seriously, if I had to deal with a year of this shit after the thieves pleaded guilty, I wouldn't be interested in bargaining either. SJWs think they can get away with this shit until people start pushing back and then suddenly it's 'woaaah, communication guys'

Previous r/KotakuInAction discussion with 232 comments [is here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3t4ke2/feminist_labour_politician_mocks_discussing_high/)

What's happened since is there's been a major backlash against the feminist's outrageous behaviour and she's now faces total humiliation since the debate on male suicide is now **going ahead today**. Better still, it's not just any old male suicide debate, but **an official International Men's Day debate** too! (exactly the thing she didn't want). Here's all the official UK Parliament documentation for the debate, showing it takes place at 13:30 UK time on Thursday November 19th 2015: http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CDP-2015-0097/CDP-2015-0097.pdf

More great news is that a politician on Twitter has now noticed the University of York controversy and has committed to speaking in the debate as a direct result of what the SJWs have done:
>""@UniOfYork because of the 'outrage,' about @UKmensday I'm going to speak in tomorrow's debate in Parliament."" https://twitter.com/lucyallan/status/667082782129172480

Furthermore, the MP for York constituency has now committed to taking part too and has even come out in support of International Men's Day too, despite being from the same party of the vile feminist that opposed it!. Therefore it's almost inevitable that **the whole fiasco is going to be officially raised and placed in Parliament's records for eternity!**

This is a hell of an opportunity for us, but as you all know the one remaining problem is the lack of media ethics - they'll either lie and try to spin the story in some stupid way or perhaps pretend the debate never even happened. In fact there was at least one of the usual anti-male IMD piece out by the usual suspects even before IMD had started.

I believe we can help to combat this and really have some fun at the same time, so I'd like to propose some simple steps everyone can easily take to help

**HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO**

1. Show some support for anyone speaking at the debate or maybe tweet a few politicians right now to suggest they speak out and attend. Ask if they support **#InternationalMensDay**. Every UK politician who uses Twitter is listed here: https://twitter.com/gov/lists/uk-mps/members - if we all pick say 5-10 at random to tweet we'll get through them all.

2. Lets get **#InternationalMensDay** trending on Twitter to really make our point. This could be done by simply wishing the likes of Jess Phillips or the York Feminists Happy #InternationalMensDay"". In fact you can combine this with point one and just wish the politicians Happy #InternationalMensDay especially those who fought for the debate to happen such as MP Philip Davies - he'd have a nice surprise if he got a lot of support for sticking his neck out. In fact, just tweet to whoever you like really. Please **don't** send any nasty messages to anyone, we can win this and cause the most havoc simply by being really nice and commemorating what should be a completely innocuous event to any normal person.

I'm happy to modify any of the above if people have concerns or better ideas, but I just feel we need to do something here.

If you want IMD images to go with your ""Happy #InternationalMensDay"" tweets then a great source is this Twitter account: https://twitter.com/TicklishQuill

**Update** - it has just emerged that the male suicide rate in York is one of the highest in England: http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/13879425.display/

**UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE!!**
So, the debate went ahead and it was epic, don't think it's on-line yet but the great news that even York got a mention as we all hoped!
Furthermore, despite saying she cared about men's issues and saying she'd attend the debate, Jess Phillips chickened out and stayed at home instead! **Utter humiliation for her**. She's clearly bitter though and just can't let it go so instead of doing her job she chose to write a lame article in the Independent about why IMD wasn't needed.

Apparently York University have agreed to sit down and discuss the issues with the guy who's been leading the campaign to reinstate IMD there

Also International Men's Day trended all day today with over 100K tweets.

Now, more purported information has come out: a supposed Facebook conversation between an SRS doxxer and CWM. Moreover, there is a 'public message' from the Fempire (which refers to SRS and its offshoots) in which they vow to start trying to take control of other 'problematic' subs.

The account in question posted this to /r/subredditcancer bragging about it. Not to mention the fact that they know for sure that the corrupt media is in the tank for them, and that it will gladly aid them in their doxxing.

It is not clear whether there is any validity to this or if it's just trolling, but one thing is for sure: SRS has been known to doxx people in the past. [Sargon, Milo, Boogie were all doxxed early on in Gamergate by SRS,](https://imgur.com/BNlLKcn) and there were a ton of /r/antiSRS mods who were doxxed by this lot.

**Edit:** A small minority seems to respond without reading this post. I am presenting the facts as they are. So a Facebook conversation we don't know for sure occurred is a *supposed* Facebook conversation. And this is just a 'report', not something established with certainty. Among other qualifiers that make clear we're talking about something that is not certain - but it is still useful information to have, because it may very well be true, and it represents SRS tactics used in the past. It is not as if I am presenting something with the 'Verified' tag when it's a lie, and I know it's a lie."

Words fail me. Social Justice Warriors have reduced universities to places that pander to the lowest common denominator. The most pathetic, whining, imbecilic losers are the ones who are in charge. They decide what students get to learn. Their 'safe space' isn't just about keeping themselves ignorant: it is about making sure no one else can get to enjoy what they find 'problematic'.

Police spokesman says:

Last night, a group of protestors broke the law by defacing private property at a Northwest, DC residence. MPD takes these violations seriously,  and we will work to hold those accountable for their unlawful actions. There is currently an open criminal investigation regarding this matter""

How did they get the personal information?

>Hi KiA

>Sorry for the typos and weird syntax, english is not my mother tongue.
I am Gilles Matouba and there is a thin chance of you knowing me. Still, I am a veteran french game developer with 15 years of experience in the industry. Mostly at Ubisoft and Eidos Montreal.
Until september 2014 I was the Game Director of DXMD at Eidos Montreal.
3 years ago Andre Vu, the Brand Director of the DX franchise, and I coined the term 'Mechanical Apartheid'.
Thing is... I am Black (& French...). And Andre is Asian (& French).

>When we decided to go all-in on delivering the experience to play as Adam Jensen, an Augmented, in a world agressively segragating his own kind, we actually wanted to offer to our audience something unique. Something that was close and very personal to us: The experience of being torn between 2 worlds and 2 identities. Augs calling you the 'uncle Tom' of the non-augs, non-augs always insecure when you're around, always deeply being scared or appaled by your mechanical body.
Somehow, it was our own individual stories... We wanted to share a little part of our own life experience (on a super dramatized degree, of course) as visible minorities in a world of prejudices sometimes not well tailored for us.
We also used the reference of south africa, israel, even brasil, french and american ghettos and any country ressorting to walls in order to segratgate a part of their own population. We meant it. This was important to us to not half-ass these analogies. BECAUSE THIS IS DEUS EX.

>Deus Ex is a very mature and thoughtful franchise that wants to hook gamers on essential questions and considerations: power, control, species, science, sociology, singularity, etc.

>Racism is a ey dark part of our human nature and we wanted to treat this subject. It was especially important for ME to treat this.
So it makes me sad and angry that these ignorant people just ASSUME that everyone behind this game is ill-spirited, stupid, and more importantly for me, that they that they are all WHITE. (For them devs==white, gamers==white)

>What these bloggers and tweeters did to me here is beyond mere insults: They have degraded me and have literally erased my identity as a black developer and as a black creator that just wanted to share a piece of himself with this game.
I wish that they will feel bad about it. I wish they will have the decency to apologize of their gross false assumptions and accusations. To apologize to all the people back in Quebec that have been working hard FOR YEARS to make this game to happen. But since they have no spine, no shame and no self respect they will simply ignore this post (once again denying me voice, legitimacy and identity) and will at best move on another AAA target to toss their freshly defecated shit at.
They don't deserve anyone's attention. They don't deserve our industry, our games and the dedication we put into them. They disgust me.

>TL : DR Asian guy and black guy came up with the term Mechanical Apartheid 3 years ago. Black guy not happy about the SJW shit tweets and wants to call them out and expose their stupidity. Black guy is not their shield.

I feel like this is just getting ridiculous and reddit is introducing more and more ways to filter right leaning subs while propping up the left.  At this point, I can see no reason to create this ""feature"" other than to silence conservatives and give leftists the entire front page.  ESPECIALLY since this is now the default.  Filtered subs include r/the_donald, but not r/politics, r/trumpgret, r/politicalhumor, etc.  

What's the communities opinion on this?  Because my view is that they might as well just go ahead and delete the_donald.  At least their intentions would be made plain then.

Edit:  Mods just informed me via a sticky that, yes, KiA is filtered out of r/popular.  I'm reminded of a quote by Benjamin Franklin.  

""We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.""

**I was going to fix the mess my phone made of this up when I got home, but then my Pokemon Go Plus arrived and I'm writing a review of it/testing it out. THIS THING IS SO COOL. Please understand**

So, the past few years with all the hysteria over making sure women who game aren't harassed because of their gender, I've been sitting confused on the sidelines. 

I had never been harassed for being a girl gamer ever, as far as I could recall. Yeah, you run into assholes sometimes, but they're just assholes and that's that. No one ever singled me out, told me I didn't belong or told me to leave because I was a girl. So I went on my merry way rolling up characters, splatting enemies and finishing my living Pokedex. 

Where I wondered, was all this awful stuff I had been told about. Was it just because I didn't play certain games where the community was more vitriolic? Was I not a real gamer if I hadn't been exposed to the awful undercurrent that I was told existed underlying all things gaming? 

Well yesterday, I realized the answer. What other women saw as harassment and what I saw as harassment were not the same thing at all. I figured harassment meant someone following you home, messaging you horrible things, swatting you, trying to get you fired, groping you or something else horrible.  Turns out most people don't feel that way. 

Bear with me I'm gonna tell you two boring stories to show you where I'm coming from.

My mother raised me to believe that if someone's being a jerk to you because you're a girl, that's their problem not yours. When I was six I went to an after school thing at the YMCA. One day I was jumping around on some big foam blocks with him, playing seesaw and running barefoot across the big vynil shapes. We decided to make a fort and I was really excited- with two kids working instead of one, we could do a ton! And then he told me that he would build the fort and I could only watch because I was a girl, and so I was weak and dumb. I didn't listen, and I built that fucking fort without his help. I told this to my mother, who looked at me, asked if he was ethic (yes, and his mom was wearing a niquab/hijab thing) explained to me that some cultures teach their boys women are inferior  and told me 

**""it sounds to me like his behavior is a personal problem""**

Now when I'm gaming if someone says something sexist to me, I just file it under ""wow they have a problem, what a jerk"". Because 100% of the time theyre an equivalent amount of jerkface to the other guys at the table. My being a girl is just an easy thing to get on about. The other guys will end up the butt of other types of nasty jokes or unfunny insults. 

Take for example my fiancé's ex gaming group. The minute I joined their D&D session (with a female bard) they made a bunch of jokes about me rolling for breast size, how my bard should be a stripper, blah blah blah. Okay that kind of joke is funny maybe once, but they continues to mention it every 5 min throughout the entire game. Ok clearly none of you have the brains to think of better jokes.  These guys were way more cringe than funny. Whatever, we'll see how this session goes. They were even more of assholes during the session- the entire party was just nasty and negative. It's been awhile so I forget what was said  exactly, but within 20 min I found out that there were at least 3 double crosses going on and no one liked each other. Okay, these guys are negative balls of suck, not playing with them again!

Told my fiancé that that session was boring and nasty, he agreed but it was the only gaming group he could find. Sure whatever, I said, but I told him they were assholes and I predicted the groups implosion within a week. My prediction was right, my fiancé leaving a week after I did. Apparently the stuff they said to me was just the beginning of their dickishness towards each other and my fiancé. Right, just as I called it the end. 

But I never ever considered what they said to be harassment against a female gamer, because it was clear to me that they were just not nice people all around. Now I'm realizing that and countless other small encounters I've had (the guy a decade older who wouldn't stop pursuing me for a ""date"" until I blocked him on all social media) is what other girl gamers consider harassment because of their gender. But he was also an asshole known for ripping people off in card trades and stealing shit. So why should I consider his treatment of me to be singling me out  and not just a continuation of his assholeness? 

It wa just a different kind of awfulness that expresses itself. 

I guess what I came to realize is, whenever someone says something nasty to me about being a girl, there is 100% chance they will be just as rude to the men at the table/teamspeak/whatever. And so I file them in my little ""asshole"" box and walk away, because it's really not worth internalizing. Because if I tell myself ""it's because I'm a gamer girl"" then that implies somehow I'm inadequate, or a victim and I'm helpless and there's nothing to be done. It also implies I need to try to ""correct"" their behavior. Which I'm not going to do. Because if 99% of the people I game with are awesome, I'm not going to waste my time interacting with the 1% that's not because it's my duty to fix them! And what about the rest of their behavior? The part that for some reason makes them an inherent jerkface? If you're above 18 and can't figure out the right and wrong times for dirty jokes or how to play with others, that sounds like your problem not mine. 

Edit: omg so many typos!! So hard to proofread on your phone. I'll fix stuff after work

The sales have been pretty amazing on Steam and it proves once and for all that gamers care about the quality of the video game itself, not politics or drama. I think it's hilarious to see the traditional games media falling over themselves once again when it comes to reviewing games. They're completely out of touch with what gamers actually want to play and I imagine it must be really satisfying for Daniel to know that despite their best efforts, these shitty game journalists made no noticeable impact on the success of his game, leaving them scratching their heads, trying to figure out why nobody actually listens to them any more for purchasing advice.

Totally disagree with Bahar Mustafa being arrested for saying the wrong words. Free speech means nothing unless applied to everyone. What she said was hateful, childish, nasty and wrong. But she was viciously ridiculed for it. That’s the system working as intended. I don’t want to live in a world where the government gets involved in policing speech. Anyone’s speech.

We point out factual inaccuracies, conflicts of interest and general media malfeasance which is often (but not always) due to agenda-pushing by some in the media. Think about it this way: we try and hold the media to account so of course they try to portray us in the worst light possible.

We are also strongly anti-censorship. If you believe that people should be free to create what they want in any way they want without being stifled and shamed due to moral panics and social agendas, you will find that you are among like-minded people.

GamerGate is extremely diverse. We are made up of people from a wide variety of political and social backgrounds and many of our strongest voices are women, minorities as well as gay and transgendered individuals. In fact, what drives many of our critics to apoplexy is that GamerGate is actually far more ""diverse"" than they are.

Some may remember two articles Salon published involving a self-identified pedophile called Todd Nickerson. One was giving his story of becoming an ethical pedophile, meaning opposed to sexual contact with kids, that included a prior history of being on ""pro-contact"" forums i.e. forums for pedophiles who favored sexual contact with kids. This caused some controversy and Milo [wrote a piece](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/21/heres-why-the-progressive-left-keeps-sticking-up-for-pedophiles/) trashing Salon over it with a shout-out to our favorite anti-GamerGate pedophile Sarah Nyberg (who claimed to be a 20-year-old teenage edgelord). The author of the Salon piece got hit rather viciously apparently, though this is hardly surprising, and later did a follow-up. 

At this point I would note some key context of these articles. When Milo is talking about pedophilia in the Rogan interview and Drunken Peasants stream, he is mostly talking about this in response to Salon's article. He mentions Nickerson playing the victim and complaining about harassment during the Rogan interview and the DP are looking at the interview when the pedophilia discussion comes up in that stream. The remarks Milo makes about the definition of pedophilia are true. Medically speaking, pedophilia is defined as a primary or exclusive sexual attraction towards pre-pubescent minors and it is not generally accepted that attraction towards pubescent and post-pubescent minors should be considered paraphilias because such attraction is within the biological norm. 

Unlike Milo's comments about some teenagers being capable of consent, sincere or not, Salon's pieces were talking about interests that met the clinical definition of pedophile. Nickerson spoke of sexual attraction towards a seven year-old neighbor girl and others around that age. Archives of the two articles are as recent as [mid-January of this year](https://archive.is/9ic0i) and [late December of last year](http://archive.is/l0X17). [Neither](http://archive.is/OP6Kb) of the [articles](http://archive.is/HdWxY) attacking Milo over his comments about some teenagers being able to consent make any mention of Salon previously publishing articles by a self-confessed pedophile attracted to seven-year-olds. They did sneak in a dig against GamerGate, however.

Edit: I didn't see the link and since the piece has apparently been deleted as well I couldn't find the url, but here is [another article](https://archive.fo/OSbEp) focusing on the ""harassment"" Nickerson received. He repeatedly calls out Breitbart as being responsible for his harassment. This is what Milo was referring to in his Rogan interview when he started talking about pedophilia. Thanks to /u/CrankyDClown.

Edit 2: Per /u/sodiummuffin the [articles](http://web.archive.org/web/20170111215344/http://www.salon.com/2015/09/21/im_a_pedophile_but_not_a_monster/) [appear](http://web.archive.org/web/20170111213714/http://www.salon.com/2015/09/30/im_a_pedophile_youre_the_monsters_my_week_inside_the_vile_right_wing_hate_machine/) to have been deleted on January 11th of this year. While it doesn't impact the ethical issues and hypocrisy of it, it may have simply been convenient timing on their part that they deleted those pieces just a little bit before this controversy blew up.

Granted, it's not easy being any Bioware employee on twitter right now, but that doesn't excuse things like overt sexual harassment.

We've had a ton of threads trashing the quality of the game and Bioware as a company, and those will always be fair game.  Obviously, none of them have come remotely close to posting personal information or encouraging people to harass any particular employee

But the narratives are already spinning up, bloggers and journalists will connect invisible dots between vulgar trolls on twitter and any and all criticism of Andromeda itself.  There are already mutterings among Bioware fanboys that the alt-right is responsible for a hate campaign against Bioware and that all complaints about the animation are sourced to them.

*FBI was involved as early as September 2014

*Someone possibly went to court over this - 21 of the redacted pages are labelled ""Sealed pursuant to Court Order""

*At the (very reasonable) request of the KotakuInAction mods, I redacted the name of one Twitter account mentioned in the first .pdf related to the early death threats.  This is because that account has long since been deleted and that someone else later registered a Twitter account in that person's name.  The person's a normie and doesn't need to be involved in this.

*More information on the USU threats that catapulted GamerGate into the international sphere  (including one death threat that mentioned over 9000 bombs, kiddo)

*No, Anita didn't send the death threat to herself.  Wtf is wrong with you?

*Someone opened up a bank account in the name of a senior executive for Intel shortly after they made their $300 million diversity investment announcement. The person opened up a bank account in the name of one of their senior management using their SSN and everything  While likely related, it is possible this was a coincidence of timing.

*One of the people involved in harassment was a teenager in Indiana.  Was part of a group of people trying to fuck with people.

*Vast majority of the people responsible for harassment and death threats were trolls.

*The FBI's visit to Mr. Repzion is mentioned.  Not explicitly by his name due to Privacy Act redactions, but I did get confirmation from him re: The pages mentioning a person the FBI interviewed who said he would create a YouTube video of what happened

*It is highly unlikely this covers everything that went on - I sadly know of at least one felony that never got reported to the FBI where someone pro-GG ended up homeless for four months due to two aGG spooking her employer out of assigning her hours.

*THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GETS THE INVESTIGATIVE GREASE.  If you're subject to heinous abuse - REPORT IT TO THE FBI.  This is a general statement.  Don't think they won't care.

>To me it seems a badly phrased rule - it doesn't clarify whether it's referring to a paid placement in the curator list itself or the external media, although I would sway towards the former as people are linking external media other lists and they would have no knowledge if it was a paid review. Steam usually don't give a crap about anything outside of their influence, so this also makes me think it's specifically paid placement on the Curator lists.
I should add that everything on there is stuff we have legitimately enjoyed playing afterwards, it's not a sellout, we weren't paid to put anything on that list. Feel free to email us, but highly likely that until better clarification of the rules exist, there will be many curator lists with similar confusions.

>Technically, a free copy of a game supplied could even be compensation - which means all the Youtubers with lists that I've seen are also breaking the rules, and that's assuming they've not done any brand deals (which is very unlikely). Steam needs to clarify the whole thing amongst other bits of T&S they're been tweaking - and also change 'read the review' to 'for more information' or something similar, as a video isn't written.

1594,"She's at it again, playing the victim and claiming that people just sitting there is ""intimidation"", while her own insults were of course completely appropriate. In fact, criticizing her is ""gaslighting"", which she calls one of the worst forms of harassment.

Get this straight: ""you suck"" and ""you're a liar"" are 'harassment' bad enough to go to the UN to complain about it, but calling someone ""shithead"" and ""garbage human"" is not, and in fact, if someone suggests that it is, then that person is also harassing Anita Sarkeesian.

> Good morning! Let's talk about gaslighting! Gaslighting, one of the most psychologically damaging types of harassment, is when serial abusers present false information or a false narrative to make you doubt your own memory, perceptions, sanity, or professional knowledge.

False narrative? So the (gaming) media are gaslighters and by extension harassers? OK.

> Gaslighting shows up in many different ways, from abusive interpersonal relationships where you are made to doubt your own **lived experiences,** to online hate mobs that tell you that their abuse is not actually abuse…

This is common in Social Justice circles, namely suggesting that someone's claims about supposed ""lived experiences"" can never be questioned. Facts can't get in the way of what people decide.

""Could it be that I'm wrong?""  
""No, it's the rest of the world that's full of harassers."" 

Also, there is only one reality. There is no ""your own reality"". I guess that's where the problem originates.

You're not crazy. I'll give you one thing, you are very good at conning people. Of course, you're targeting people who want to be conned, but still. Those web seminars you advertised were really good.

Not a single 'journalist' has asked for any evidence that Sargon in any way harassed her. Not a single 'journalist' has looked at the evidence himself. These people just repeat whatever she says as though it were Gospel. So what they do is accuse someone like Sargon, who has repeatedly said that you shouldn't even *contact* these professional victims, let alone 'harass' them, of harassment. Libel suit when?"

1597,"[How a CNN Investigation Set Off an Internet Meme War](https://archive.is/I8Ijb#selection-2669.43-2669.95). Context paragraph, all bold mine:

> By midday on Wednesday, the meme armies on **Reddit, 4chan, Discord and other right-wing enclaves** had declared that “the second meme war” had begun. (Meme War I, according to these groups, was getting Mr. Trump elected in the first place.)

4chan could defensibly be called a right-wing enclave. Reddit is a left-wing enclave if anything. And Discord is not an enclave any more than *email* is an enclave, because Discord isn't a site, it's a *program* that squillions of people use for decentralized communication on squillions of local servers and channels with little connection to each other, which frequently are *invite-only and hidden*. Compare Reddit, which runs frequent internal cross-promotion, and you can click a user to see all the subs they post in. (Bonus complaint: the article repeatedly has one-sentence paragraphs. The editor in me screams.)

> To understand how Reddit memes could ignite a national controversy and put a multibillion-dollar media company on its heels, it helps to know that right-wing meme-makers are a particularly prolific and vocal internet subcommunity. **They gather in clusters on Reddit, and similar sites like 4chan and Discord,** in order to trade images and strategize about disseminating them to wide audiences.

Again, Discord is not a site one can gather on. Which the author manages to get right in a different paragraph, oddly enough:

> On **Discord, a chat app for gamers** where several right-wing factions congregate in private groups, the news of a new, high-profile feud was cause for celebration. Some even likened the effort to humiliate CNN to Peter Thiel’s well-publicized campaign to take down Gawker, another longtime enemy of the online right.

This is how you get ""fake news"" memes. The New York Times and its adulators love to claim that it's not merely another newspaper, it is a very prestigious, respectable, reliable newspaper, one with layers of editors and fact-checkers and professionalism, not like those \*sniffs disdainfully\* right-wing tabloids that print any old trash and nonsense. And then I see it talking about something where I know the subject, and I notice that the author can't keep his story straight and is probably at several removes from the subject.

Wait. Back up. What was the other sentence in that last paragraph?

> Peter Thiel’s well-publicized campaign to take down Gawker, another longtime enemy of the online right.

She has since protected her account. The tweets in the Imgur album come from another account I can't link to because it has fewer than 2500 followers. However, McKellop herself has a lot more, so her own tweets should be fine. 

The reaction should not be underestimated. The tweet in support of her has over 2,000 retweets. They are pressuring the University to take no adverse actions against this racist, and while I support people's right to be racist and retain their job, I don't think someone openly discriminating against some students should be retaining this sort of job.

Hat tip to /r/GamerGhazi for bringing this to my attention.

I believe the one that was banned did not receive the message because that account had never posted there.  However, I found I had posted there, as a commentor below pointed out,  a year and a half ago and 2 years ago,  a total of twice,  which allowed the ban message through."

What CNN Claims she said. 

>""What are we legally able to do?"" Dr. Betty Price, a Republican, asked Dr. Pascale Wortley, director of the HIV/AIDS Epidemiology Surveillance Section at the Georgia Department of Public Health. ""I don't want to say the 'quarantine' word, but I guess I just said it. ... What would you advise, or are there any methods, legally, that we could do that would curtail the spread?""

[Here is the video of her testimony.](https://livestream.com/accounts/19771805/events/7373366/videos/164414232) 

What she ACTUALLY said. 

>""**Before you proceed, if you wouldn't mind commenting on the surveillance of partners and the tracking of contacts, that sort of thing.** What are we legally able to do?"" Dr. Betty Price, a Republican, asked Dr. Pascale Wortley, director of the HIV/AIDS Epidemiology Surveillance Section at the Georgia Department of Public Health. ""I don't want to say the 'quarantine' word, but I guess I just said it. ... What would you advise, or are there any methods, legally, that we could do that would curtail the spread?""

Why is that line important? Well, if you go to 57 minutes in the video, you'll note the HIV specialist is discussing a very specific population. People who are getting diagnosed and then refusing treatment, or people who get treatment and then stop treatment. This is an issue because keeping HIV at a ""suppressed"" viral load makes it very difficult to transmit. If people stop their medication, they remain at a higher load and can spread it easier. 

The lawmaker here is a doctor, and she's asking what they can legally do in order to get into contact with people who have been exposed, and people who are NOT going to care, to get care or hold them responsible for their higher rates of transmission. This is a concern because as the doctor said, there is a HUGE difference between people who take their drugs consistently, and those who either do not, or who only go to treatment ""intermittently"" (When they get sick). 

Instead of presenting the conversation in context, or hell even fully quoting her--they are attempting to rail road her, even going so far as to literally simply fabricate something she had not said. "

The video went viral, getting over 6 million views before being taken down after an overwhelmingly negative response. What has happened since has been an attempt by TED to purge the video from the internet, as all mirrors on YouTube and Vimeo have at the time been taken down, all with a notice that they've been taken down due to a third party claim by ""TED Conferences LLC"".

This is already bad in and of itself for obvious reason, but it gets worst when one takes into account the fact that TED does not own the copyright to TEDx videos. If someone wants to upload one, unedited, in its entirety, they are allowed to do so, in fact most videos of theirs that go viral do so on other channels then their official one. TED has no legal basis for issuing takedowns, and yet it is, for reasons that are pretty obvious given the image problem the video creates (despite the nature of TEDx and its relationship to TED).

The worrying thing about this is as of yet I haven't seen any YouTubers make mention of this video, which is very worrying since without more attention from outside a few corners of the web this video could be memoryhole'd successfully.

Here's a link to one of the mirrors to prove it existed and TED took it down (unless it has gone back up at a later date):  [https://vimeo.com/275892531](https://vimeo.com/275892531)

1647,"Alright, so first things first -- as of a few weeks ago, I am no longer under a gag. Apologies for not notifying everyone the instant it happened, but, it seemed best to get advice and think through the best course of action before opening a potential can of worms. I think I've decided on what that course should be, but more on that later.

First (second?), I can now safely tell you about the secret stretch goal:

Back when I filed my appeal and served the plaintiff with my Statement of Issues on Appeal, she responded by trying to take out a back-up order in a new state. She plainly listed my appeal of the MA order as one of the reasons she was requesting a new order. 

The just-fill-out-this-form-and-we'll-give-you-an-ex-parte order granted by that state was even more restrictive than the Massachusetts order, but only for about two days, until my attorney intervened and the judge agreed there were serious first amendment issues with the original wording, and modified the order to something more reasonable until the hearing.

Over the next couple of weeks, the plaintiff argued that the order should be granted because she has Google Alerts set up to monitor my online activity, which means if I reference her anywhere online, that therefore constitutes contacting her. 

Let that sink in for a minute. 

Anyway, luckily, the state she filed the request in has a much saner system for dealing with these things than Massachusetts does. You aren't just given a quick 5 minute hearing with no means to provide context or information. You are allowed to file declarations and cite legal authorities and have the judge look at the evidence before the hearing starts. An opportunity to actually be heard turned out to be tremendously helpful. 

The judge read our declarations, she looked at the evidence, she heard our lawyer's arguments, and then she very politely called bullshit and dismissed the case. This dismissal was on jurisdictional grounds, but that's not as boring a technicality as it seems. In dismissing on jurisdictional grounds, she held that my online speech which the plaintiff entered into evidence did not constitute threats or harassment, and so did not rise to the level required to establish jurisdiction. 

I'm exceedingly thankful to my lawyer, who was willing to take the case on a pay-what-you-can basis on absurdly short notice. So far I've paid for like half of his time.

Back in Massachusetts, my appellate attorney and I decided that -- because of the constitutional questions posed -- it would be best to ask the state Supreme Court to look at the issue directly instead of having the appellate court handle it first. This increased the cost of the appeal somewhat, and so I did a second donation drive to compensate. 

To everyone who donated -- thank you. Here is the petition for Direct Appellate Review you paid for. 

http://162.243.138.46/funding/DAR%20Valkerburg%20v%20Gjoni.pdf

UCLA law professor and general First Amendment scholar and superhero Eugene Volokh wrote a letter in support of Direct Appellate Review, and agreed to file an amicus brief on my behalf for the appeal. You can read professor Volokh's letter in support of Direct Appellate review here.

http://162.243.138.46/funding/letter%20in%20support.doc

This apparently left the plaintiff in a tricky position where she could neither avoid losing in front of a higher court, nor use the back-up order she attempted to take out in another state to prevent me from speaking when she did lose. So, she opted to try to moot the issue on appeal by requesting the original order be vacated before the Supreme Judicial court or Appellate Court could weigh in on the case. 

She notified the Supreme Judicial Court and Appellate Court of her intention to vacate the order. We notified the courts that we believe the issue is not moot, even if the orders were vacated (we believe we have strong grounds here).

On August 14th, we filed our appellate brief. Again, this would not have been possible without you, so thank you. My attorney and I worked hard on it, here it is if you would like to read it.

http://162.243.138.46/funding/Valkerburg%20v.%20Gjoni%20Appellate%20Brief.pdf

Soon thereafter, professor Volokh filed an amicus. 

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/08/gjonifiled.pdf

Around August 22nd, a lower court judge vacated the underlying order. 

On September 15th (yes a day late, but it's not a big deal), the plaintiff filed her response brief in the appellate court (we're still waiting to find out if the Supreme Judicial Court takes the case). Her brief was entirely dedicated to arguing that -- because the underlying order was vacated -- the higher court should not rule on the case. ([Hats-off to Broteam for wonderfully prescient comedy](https://twitter.com/broteampill/status/633768044834242560))

After she filed, my attorney e-mailed me with the following (censored for sensitive content): 

>You should think about a few things: how do you want to spend the money you have left for this?  If you want to continue with this litigation, we can file a reply brief, keep ourselves alive in the MAC and see what happens with the SJC. . . 
 
>If you want to turn back now, that’s always an option, too. We can talk tomorrow if you like. I will proceed as though we are going to write a reply brief (we have 14 days).  

So my options now are to drop it and take the easy way out to clear my record, everything else be damned. Or, to affirm that this order was illegitimate, and try to make case-law protecting other people (in Massachusetts anyway) from being unconstitutionally subject to similar orders.

The attorney estimates the reply brief would take about 10 hours of work. Accounting for consultations, motions, oral argument if the court deems it necessary, and outstanding balance from the brief, that should come out to about $6,000 - $7,000 more dollars. (Including the $16,000 that has already been raised, this brings the total to ~~$21,000~~ roughly $23,000*).

I don't have that much money. So -- please try my brand new pay-to-play MMO choose-your-own adventure experimental indie game :D. 

Like many experimental indie games, it contains deep socio-political commentary/implications, required very little programming, and makes use of some novel gameplay mechanics. Here's how it's played:

Open [this link](http://162.243.138.46/funding/drive.php) in a new tab.

1. If you think I should see this through, and hopefully make case law (and you have some cash you can't think of a better use for, seriously don't do this if you're strapped): use that tab to donate.

2. If you think I should turn back now: Close that tab. I should probably not have asked you to open the tab unless you were picking option 1. I'm sorry. Please accept this [unfinished browser-game](http://162.243.138.46/TorturedTrembling4.html) as an apology.

In all seriousness though, yeah. Those are my options for now. And this is, in summary, where things currently stand. 

As for the gag order: I could technically say anything I want to right now. I could, without fear of legal repercussion, come out about what it was that worried me enough to write thezoepost. The evidence of the troublesome stuff that worried me and was at the time not sufficiently conclusive to justify speaking to, has in the interim steadily accrued and toppled over its own weight.

However, in that same interim, two other things happened: A number of very smart people I've asked for advice thought it would likely be counterproductive to speak given the political climate. And two articles written about Nyberg by the Wrong Type Of Person, led a number of big voices to come to her defense in a knee-jerk partisan reaction -- thereby vindicating the smart people's words of caution. The issues behind TZP are in an entirely different realm from Nyberg's, and I may write about them eventually, but, probably not for a while.

That said, I realize you guys might have questions, and also that it would be rather anticlimactic for me to finally be able to speak, just to choose not to (though, I do love a good anti-climax). I will in the coming days, likely post a delayed-response AMA. I'll avoid answering most of the questions directly, unless they are especially innocuous. But, I will aggregate them and post a FAQ somewhere addressing whatever it seems acceptable or wise to address. You can also message me privately if you feel it's appropriate, but, I can't guarantee I'll respond if I think the answer seems like it might get misused. (*glares at CameraLady*). 

Anyway, thanks for everything so far. I have a ton on my plate at the moment but, I'm down to see this through if you are. Feel free to leave any (preferably legal) questions you may have here, I'll be around.

in this 17 minute video, Sinatra Says reports on a lawsuit filed by the parents of a bullied teen against 5 ""Mean Girls"" who conspired to ""get him expelled""  and got him fired from his job, spent time in juvenile detention, and is now homeschooled with severe psychological trauma.  and it was all due to mere accusations with one story too wild to be for real.

first accusation was when on girl told the pool the boy worked as a lifeguard that he sexuaally assaulted her and that got him fired.

then two of her friends i believe backed up her claim and got the guy on a sexual assault charge and hat the entire school go against him.

third incident was when a 4th friend told the school counselor that the kid somehow when to her house entered the door and went to her room to assault her without her parents being aware and I think this got him wrist shackles and 9 days in juvie with the rest of the sentence being house arrest.

this happened around last year and eventually, the girls admitted to making the whole thing up.

""we didn't like the way he talked we didn't like the way he looked"" they explained and they wanted him expelled.

after this came to light the district attorney said they would drop the charges but they have not done so yet.  the lawsuit claims this is due to gender discrimination especially since the 5 girls had no repercussions either.

the boy now suffers from deep mental trauma and has to go to a therapist, and apparently is manifesting physical symptoms of the stress of being punished for something you know you didn't do.

EDIT since he didnt provide the article in question i found the Daily Mail article and i think the orignal TribLive article.

##[**""Mean Girls"" SUED over False Allegations** - *Lawful Masses with Leonard French*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHPH3grlgSk&feature=youtu.be)

it is worse..SO much worse!  the house assault incident was a frame job as the girls invited him and offered alcohol and weed which the guy did not partake and went home shortly after.

and it was pure character assassination as he wasn't allowed to play on the school baseball team because the uniform represents the school.  and he had to wear an ankle bracelet but could not disclose that fact so he had to wear long pants during blazing summer weather.

also the whole house incident paints the boy as the victim of assault as one of the girls were drunk and had her hand down his pants while his hands were not down hers.  

and the gender-based discrimination is due to the District Attorney refusing to pursue arrests on the girls despite solid evidence.

EDIT: small but satisfying update: i have word that the Mean Girls are considered ""Total Bitches"" and that the whole student body backs the guy who was falsely accused and have started a hashtag campaign (though unsure if I can repeat it here as I don't know if it contains dox)

EDIT:  some detail about the girls from one commentor:

> [**Yeah that girls parents are on the school board. A few are cheerleaders, It's totally fucked. Not many people like them, the title mean girls is very fitting, if you ever had those elitist, stuck up, full of themselves girls in school. Alot of the administration doesn't care about bullying and the dean of students is biased towards students that get good grades. He was one the nicest kids I met and when I was new there was one the first people to talk to me. A little awkward but a great person. Our school has a serious hazing problem and a very large gap between social classes. It basically came down to that they found him annoying and wanted to get him out of their classes. I dont think they intended for as much damage as they did, but it's still very wrong. I know 2 of the girls plan on going cyber from embarrassment. We had a ""flood night"" at our football game last week with t shirts we made saying ""we stand for flood"".

**UPDATE 2:** To clear up some confusion, as this seems to be difficult to understand for one individual in particular: obviously, the king was married and therefore had a Queen.

Specifically, one of the technical board members is conservative and will not accept her attempts to redefine rape to mean ""regret,"" and wants to force him off the board for ""conflicts of interest"" -- read: he doesn't agree with her. This technical board is the board that will be overseeing any COC complaints. That means that the predicted attempts to fill the COC enforcement committee with SJW gatekeepers is already well on the way.

Sarah Sharp has been discussed on KIA before -- notably, 2 years ago she [ragequit](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3npyz6/listen_and_believe_sarah_sharp_and_the_register/) the Linux mailing list, citing Linus being ""brutal"" -- in effect, she was trying to tone police Linus and the entire kernel mailing list. This ""fainting couch"" maneuver was picked up by sympathetic media throughout the tech sphere.

It is worth noting that Sarah Sharp is also a member of the Ada Initiative.  The [Ada Initiative officially closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3fxeng/happenings_social_justice_racketeering_update/) 3 years ago, but in actuality it just renamed and started ""diversity consulting"" firms such as ""Frame Shift Consulting"" which are designed to blackmail companies into hiring SJWs, as well as ""Double Union"" which provides ""safe spaces"" for people in tech unable to stand working with men or white people.

The Ada Initiative is also well known for being outed by Eric S Raymond for [attempting to frame Linus Torvalds for rape](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6907).

So we have a woman who, within a day of the COC being active, is attempting to get the very board that would police COC violations at the Linux Foundation purged of people who disagree with her, as well as to have any oversight and transparency removed from the process.

A woman who has intentionally tried to push a narrative on Linus Torvalds in order to get him drived out of the Linux Foundation -- something that she appears to have finally been successful at 3 years later.

A woman who has ties to a Radical Feminist organization that was literally trying to frame Linus Torvalds for rape.

The link below summarises things pretty well but tldr is that a 16 year old developer claims to have developed an app by herself and was touted as being a prodigy. However, another female (?) Developer has gone searching and discovered that she may actually have paid someone to write the app for her. Needless to say, the people who discovered this are now saying they're getting threats and people are tweeting their employers.

1725,"Before we begin, let me put a few things on the table.

1.) I don't want to see anyone posting any links anywhere at any photos or sites in this thread. I have seen some threads being removed already under rule five, and that is perfectly reasonable. Although I have no doubt that in the coming days the media will paint this as a hate mob, we still have to play this clean, at least for now.

2.) There's nothing wrong with being an escort. If Alison Rapp wants to make $250 an hour plus through sexual services, that's her choice. I'm not going to, and neither should you, make this about the fact that she was an escort.

3.)While this may seem like a cruel or improper piece of information to spread, (and this goes to the moderators here just as much as you the reader) keep in mind the reason why I believe it is important that people know this is because the entire narrative of how events have occurred has essentially become proven false by this information. Alison Rapp was not removed from Nintendo because of a 'hate mob' of misogynists due to her political beliefs or any other issue (lets not touch upon the pedophilia thing here) as the media would like the world to believe, she was removed from her position for breaching her contract.

Alison Rapp, former PR employee for Nintendo of America was fired from her position during late March. While the media put up a strong front in pushing forward the narrative that she was fired for online harassment, the official response from Nintendo of America stated that she was fired for moonlighting under another job. When this story broke I did some investigation to try and find out what this moonlighting job was, and I determined that Alison Rapp was let go from her position for being a boudoir model (bedroom modeling in lingerie, stuff like that). Again I could see very clearly why Nintendo of America would have wanted to let go a PR employee for that reason, but that didn't stop the media at large painting and narrative that she was let go from her position because of public pressure from #GamerGate. 

It turns out that Alison Rapp was not a model. Alison Rapp was offering her services as an escort (a more polite word for prostitute) in the Seattle area for high-class customers. It is most probable that this was the moonlighting job she was released for. I believe it is important for people to know this information, not because Alison Rapp was an escort or because we should go after her in some personal army campaign to try and screw with her life in particular, but because it flies in the face of the continued deceit both Rapp and the media which presented this issue have served to the public. 

One thing that I want to point out which is very concerning, is that Alison Rapp is married. I won't make any judgement now whether her husband did or did not know she offering escort services for money, but either outcome is going to be bad. I do recall some posts during my digging in which Alison Rapp said her husband was helping her set up another income stream, and that she herself said upon the topic of her sexuality that she is in an open relationship. These things in the end, are tangentially related to the issue at hand. The issue at which is at hand is that Alison Rapp and the people in the media who perpetuated a narrative that she was removed from her position because of a misogynist hate mob either did not understand a full set of the facts behind this story, or they chose not to report on facts that they didn't know (which is probably unlikely). 

Another thing I think that needs to be said; now this genie has been uncorked from the bottle, it would be better to start talking about it upfront in an environment where we can have a measured discussion. Because no matter what happens here, I have no doubt that within the next media cycle there will be a lot of words thrown around very similar to 'revenge porn' in them. So it's important for us to focus on the fact that this is not about Alison Rapp being an escort, but the fact that she lied quite openly in order to blame us for something that we had very little control over.

tl;dr alsion rapp was bad for lying, not for doing butt stuff

Update: /u/NPerez99 has pointed out another dimension that a lot of us have missed. The act of Prostitution and the the promotion of Prostitution are in fact, illegal in the state of Washington under Code RWC 9A.88.030 and RWC 9A.88.070. 

Full explanation of the codes are here: http://www.glblaw.com/prostitution

>**9A.88.030 Prostitution**

>(1) A person is guilty of prostitution if such person engages or agrees or offers to engage in sexual conduct with another person in return for a fee.

>(2) For purposes of this section, ""sexual conduct"" means ""sexual intercourse"" or ""sexual contact,"" both as defined in chapter 9A.44 RCW.

>(3) Prostitution is a misdemeanor.

>9A.88.050 Prostitution — Sex of parties immaterial — No defense

>In any prosecution for prostitution, the sex of the two parties or prospective parties to the sexual conduct engaged in, contemplated, or solicited is immaterial, and it is no defense that:

>(2) The person who received, agreed to receive, or solicited a fee was a male and the person who paid or agreed or offered to pay such fee was female.

>9A.88.060 Promoting prostitution — Definitions

>The following definitions are applicable in RCW 9A.88.070 through 9A.88.090:

>(1) ""Advances prostitution."" A person ""advances prostitution"" if, acting other than as a prostitute or as a customer thereof, he causes or aids a person to commit or engage in prostitution, procures or solicits customers for prostitution, provides persons or premises for prostitution purposes, operates or assists in the operation of a house of prostitution or a prostitution enterprise, or engages in any other conduct designed to institute, aid, or facilitate an act or enterprise of prostitution.

>(2) ""Profits from prostitution."" A person ""profits from prostitution"" if, acting other than as a prostitute receiving compensation for personally rendered prostitution services, he accepts or receives money or other property pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any person whereby he participates or is to participate in the proceeds of prostitution activity.

>**9A.88.070 Promoting Prostitution in the First Degree**

>(1) A person is guilty of promoting prostitution in the first degree if he or she knowingly advances prostitution by compelling a person by threat or force to engage in prostitution or profits from prostitution which results from such threat or force.

>(2) Promoting prostitution in the first degree is a class B felony.

>9A.88.080 Promoting Prostitution in the Second Degree

>(1) A person is guilty of promoting prostitution in the second degree if he knowingly:

This has become fairly well known on Twitter, but I thought that you also deserve the right to gloat.

So there is this fellow on Twitter (and yet retweeted by a senior Blizzard designer **who must also not be named here**) who says that he is a ""pixel artist"" for multiple indie projects. Now he posted the following vicious attack on TotalBiscuit, peace be upon him:

> Unpopular opinion: Totalbiscuit was a repeated defender of gamergate, a loose organization of pathetic misogynists dedicated to ruining women's lives. Game companies that honor his passing in any way are sending a message to their customers about who matters to them. **(deleted)**
>
>
> Just blocking any of the trash that tries to defend him here. I don't need to waste time arguing with dirt. **(deleted)**

Responding to some people.

> And then he supported and defended the targeted harassment of women simply for existing in his hobby. End of story. **(still up)**
>
>
>
> Maybe he did some good things, but for me the bad things erase that. I can't enjoy an artist's work when they've been tainted by things like biggotry, harassment, or abuse. **(still up)**

We've got a defender of women here, apparently, who doesn't like 'abuse'.

**The exposure** 

Turns out that there was a little... something in his past. When he was 24, he was convicted of a severe sex crime against children. He is in fact listed on government sex offender registries. The specifics of the crime are not mentioned, only a general 'level'. According to the description of that level, it's either raping a child or distributing or producing child pornography (not even just 'merely' possessing it) - or both. [This appears to be the law under which he was convicted.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252A) Unconfirmed reports say that he spent several years in jail for producing/distributing child pornography.

Tweets exposing him for this have been retweeted to thousands of people.

**The response**

The response came in two stages. First, people criticized him for attacking TotalBiscuit. Here's how he responded.

> So nice that they're all just outing themselves so I can ensure I don't ever accidentally befriend or work with them. You guys are doing me a huge favor. **(deleted)**
>
>
> How much you wanna bet Biscuit's idolators start targeting me for harassment, thereby proving what utter shit he and everyone who likes him is? **(deleted)**
>
>
> I've been pretty chill about this whole thing. Other people targeted by him and GamerGate have reason to be much angrier. But YOU weren't affected, so I should just go away. **(still up)**
>
>
> Some of these comments are so vile, Twitter won't show them to me. Real bunch of winners you've got mourning your loss, Biscuit, old buddy. **(deleted)**

As you can see, he's trying to play it cool. But when it was revealed that he is a sex offender, he did not take news of his exposure well. 

> If any of you are looking for some mindless TB sycophants to block, there are a metric shit ton of them trashing me right now for having the audacity to suggest developers not honor his memory. I have been blocking like crazy for two days. **(still up)**

He also attempted the Anita Sarkeesian gambit.

> Ain't that the truth. They are piling on my tweets right now with all sorts of death threats. To be expected. **(still up)**

For the record, I reviewed his mentions and couldn't find a single threat, let alone a death threat. This is a desperate attempt from a pedophile to try to convince SJWs that *he* is the victim, which to be honest, is not hard (see: Sarah Nyberg).

**What to do? Relocate!**

In US&A he is subject to certain restrictions, due to his status as a sex offender. For example, he can't live within 1000 feet of schools and other places where there are lots of children. He has the solution for that. He has since moved out of America. He says that this is because he cannot afford to live there anymore. At the moment, he lives in an unspecified eastern European country.

Right next to a daycare center (about 200 feet removed). This is not a drill, this is not a joke. [Here is a redacted map.](https://i.imgur.com/ikQKv0M.png) The red dot is where he lives, and the day care center is where it says ""Day Care"". 

Naturally, I can't give you the actual information, because admins, but if anyone doubts me, I'm obviously willing to send the proof to the mods for verification. 

**History**

There seems to be no history of this guy being a jerk. This is the only tweet that was archived from before this whole mess:

> Used to respect you, Shatner. Now with this misandry bullshit. Have you always been garbage? **(still up)**

This was last year. According to my sources, Shatner has been unable to sleep since then, due to a pedophile not respecting him anymore. 

**Lessons learned**

[What have we learned today?](https://i1.wp.com/www.geekcrusade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ramsay-bolton-game-of-thrones-1-e1466608446905.jpg) Not much. His Twitter profile has been changed to:

> Taking a mental health break from social media for a while. Being constantly attacked by misogynists and nazis is exhausting.

Ladies and gents, you are all misogynists and Nazis... because you don't support pedophilia. HEIL HANSEN! Any female Gamergaters... hate women, because... they don't like a man who rapes kids. Come on, it's 2018.

This is Social Justice for you.

**Edit:** There are two other interesting things that have since come to my attention. Hilariously, he requested a mod for an unspecified game that was an orphanage. I don't think it necessarily has any relation with his pedophilia, but it's funny nonetheless. Obviously, we cannot link to this mod either.

On a more serious note: he claims to be taking a ""mental health break from social media"". However, I have been keeping an eye on his Twitter account, and he has been liking a ton of tweets since he made his account private. When he made his account private (at least, the first archive there is), he had liked 2983 tweets. Now that number is up to 3005. He also continues to delete tweets. His tweets have gone down from 593 to 537. Basically, everything this guy says is a lie, something that will no doubt shock everyone here."

Originally taken from an 8chan thread. Like the original OP said, this is indeed some 1984 bullshit the likes of which the MiniTru approves of.

They say if you know the name of a demon, he has no power over you, and the social justice party now has deleted it's real name from Wikipedia.

EDIT: To all the people commenting about it, yes, something similar happened before. This post is about the article being redicted to ''Right Wing Conspiracy''. Someone in the comments posted the chronology about what happened. Also, are there really people denying/defending cultural marxism? That crap is literaly the cancer that's killing modern society, the root of identity politics, victimhood olympics, political correctness and censorship. It's Communism Lite(TM). And it can't be a right wing thing since Karl Marx was the most leftist man on earth and this is the kind of ideology preached by rich white academic-types."

1745,"[So this video was posted yesterday on this sub](https://streamable.com/shn4j), but was then removed because it linked to a Twitter account that did not have enough followers. According to the user who posted it, this was a history teacher giving a lecture on fake news - during which the Wall Street Journal was referred to as being a reliable source of news.

It has not yet been confirmed, but at the same time, there is no indication to me (other than the man's astonishing inarticulateness and stupidity) that the video is fake.

> ""And by every time you retweet one of these things or every time you promote this idea, you are promoting ignorance, racism, genocide, anti-Semitism. These are all things you are putting forward when you are doing anything that promotes Pewdiepie.
>
>
> So be careful about this. If someone decided to... if something were to happen, Pewdiepie were to be sued for this, you could be complicit. If you retweet it [variant: retweeted], they could make you pay a fine as well. Because you have officially published anti-Semit... anti-Semitic things. So if you are republishing this stuff, you could get in trouble for it. Be very aware that this is a real thing.""

I can only hope that the man is not stupid enough to believe this, and that this was a poor attempt to scare students away from having anything to do with Pewdiepie. Now I am no expert on the 'Murrican legal system (and the student confirmed that this took place in America), but I think I know a couple of things more than this supposed teacher.

1. Pewdiepie hasn't 'published' anything anti-Semitic.
2. The First Amendment protects you against being 'sued' or 'fined' even if it were actual anti-Semitism.
3. If Pewdiepie is 'sued', that has no effect on anyone else, you would have to be sued yourself.
4. If you are 'sued' for 'anti-Semitic things', and you somehow the case turned out in favor of the plaintiff, you have to pay damages, not a fine. 

In any case, it did not work. The video now has nearly a million views on Twitter and has been retweeted and quoted by very prominent accounts, whom I will not name because it would probably violate the rules to give you pointers on where to find the account. 

This is nothing but a teacher, who is likely to be a government employee, attempting to prevent students from exercising their rights through empty threats and intimidation. Thank god for this brave and awesome student standing up to this nonsense.

**Update:** As of 22:42 UTC, the video has 1.42 million views. One of the quote-retweets has over a 100,000 retweets. No word from the student yet on how things went at school today."

So why did ""Baby its cold outside"" get banned? Well because its a song sang by a white man with an audience made mostly by white people and as we know only whites can be misoginistic. White people in this country really are judged by a completly different standard than all of the other races"

After seeing this, I decided to see what the one arguably important place to see shit Reddit might not like, r/The_Donald, would have mentioned it. Yes, it's a sub about Donald Trump, but it has a track record of being one of the few places that reddit wasn't able to edit completely - the Orlando shooting is the one that comes to time as it was the only sub actively talking about it. 

Whether or not your feelings on that sub, it's reliable regarding things like this. And sure enough, with 16k points it was on the SECOND page of r/the_Donald, where on teh front page I went about four pages without any mention of this at all.

I'm being extremely tinfoily, I know, but this is something important and Netflix and reddit, huge companies that basically can control information, are actively removing parts of our history; I'm willing to bet Google and Facebook and Twitter will all follow suit soon.

This is the scariest thing I've seen in my life. All I wanted to do was play fucking video games and now I'm witnessing one of the most powerful countries on this planet corrode itself."

No, seriously, every drawn image of an anti-sexiness-in-games advocate I've ever seen has shed between 10kg and 120kg off of her body weight, fixed her skin, and been completely unrepresentative of reality. Why are they all so thin? Should we be more representative of women with different body types, or does the rule suddenly change when it's about them?

I hear a lot of people say Destiny is ""good at debating"" and ""did a great job"" but that simply isn't true IMO. I'm here to make the case that Destiny is actually a terrible debater and hasn't actually ""won"" any of his debates.

Do you know what ""Gish-Galloping"" is? It's a pretty bitchy term aimed at creationists particularly, but it applies to so many other areas of life that it really use a vital term when talking about debates. Gish-Galloping is the act of making so many claims in such a short amount of time that your opponent cannot possibly dispute them all. It works even better if many of these claims are false or extremely unfounded.

Usually, however, so-called ""Gish Galloping"" is merely a symptom of a larger evil: trying to control a conversation rather than partake in it. Do you know the reason debates often have moderators? It's because certain problem speakers have a bad habit of shouting, speaking over people, interrupting and refusing to let the other person speak. This is controlling, manipulative behavior and is unacceptable in conventional debates.

Destiny, in my opinion, is guilty of all of these things. People admire how fast he can talk, but I think it's a problem. Watch any of his debates, and you'll see him express very dominating and controlling behavior when he's talking to someone he disagrees with. He'll talk fast, put a lot of sophistry and dubious claims out there and his opponent can't concentrate on more than one, he'll talk over people, he'll interrupt and he'll often outright change the subject or refuse to allow a certain point to be brought up.

Destiny is not a good debater. He's a controlling one. He's manipulating conversations, not partaking in them. Don't fall for it.

So whenever a white guy gets off lightly for some horrible crime because he is rich, or an Ivy League athlete, or whatever, howls of indignation go up in the Social Justice cult, who allege that his 'male privilege' bailed him out. Here is a case of a privileged female student, who is being let off for stabbing her boyfriend. 

> ""It seems to me that if this was a one-off, a complete one-off, to prevent this extraordinary able young lady from not following her long-held desire to enter the profession she wishes to would be a sentence which would be too severe,"" Pringle said.

It's not male privilege or white privilege, or female privilege for that matter (save me the lecture on men receiving longer sentences, that no more proves 'female privilege' than blacks receiving longer sentences proves 'white privilege'). Rather, the justice system favors those who are rich and successful, while having no mercy on working-class people. Bail out those who are doing well, while throwing the book at the underprivileged. What's the big deal? They have no future anyway. We don't want someone to lose her career as a heart surgeon over something as trivial as stabbing her boyfriend.

This is the actual privilege that SJWs ignore. Green privilege, the only kind that exists.

> The game is less successful when it comes to its treatment of women. While there are plenty of female characters in the group, aside from one woman — who only becomes an actual gunslinging badass more than halfway through the game — they’re mostly relegated to side roles, like mothers, lovers, and caregivers. Even when the game seems like it might have something interesting to say about women’s rights, particularly in such an oppressive time, it stumbles over itself. One mission has Arthur protecting a group of protestors fighting for the right for women to vote. But their passion and bravery don’t seem to have earned much respect from Arthur. “I ain’t voted before,” he says when it’s all done, “but I’m getting kinda hot for voting rights.”

via riot's site, [mod in the comments](http://archive.is/NjFwT#selection-957.0-957.275) 

Seems like a PR move that they will backpedal on right before the event so they don't have to explain why they can't let some people in while still looking good to people online that care about this stuff but won't go nor follow up on as some new hot controversy flicks into their view. The remainder that actually care will be a fraction of an already small fraction, so it's a win.

That or they go through with it and maybe somehow don't even let guys that know the password ""I'm non-binary"" in. Way to lose a bunch of fans I guess. I don't know how anyone there got the idea that ordinary topics such as this at an open to the public event absolutely needed to not have guys in attendance.

1891,"Hey guys. Update on current happenings after the break.  

*First though, a quick history dip you can skip if you're hip.*
 
---------------------
**The story thus far:**

1. I wrote a blog post about this one time I dumped an infamous developer/activist after discovering a general pattern of hypocrisy/co-opting of political movements for personal gain. My main concern that ████████████████████████████████████████ was hinted at for those in the know though otherwise left unstated, but that's not important right now.
2. The internet exploded. 
3. Discussion was actively suppressed across multiple sites and communities, and a number of media outlets collectively decided it would be best to look the other way. The explosion continued exploding(?) for the next week, despite what seemed like a coordinated cross-community cross-outlet effort not to fuel the fire. 
4. After it became clear this wasn't going away, there was a marked switch in coverage of events from ""block information"" to ""spread misinformation."" Also at some point, ten articles in one day pronounced that gamers were dead. Gamers seemed to generally disagree with this prognosis.
5. A leak from a journos group revealed there was in fact a coordinated cross outlet effort to bury the issue. 
6. Gamergate was born -- and covered by most outlets the same way Occupy was covered by FOX News. Or #BlackLivesMatter was covered by -- uuuhh, FOX News. Which is to say, the concerns that caused the explosion were minimized or swept under the rug, and media coverage focused solely on the existence of the explosion as a scandal in and of itself. People became increasingly worried that everything had turned into FOX News. 
7. Back in my neck of the woods, that dev I had the misfortune of dating went into damage control mode. Dev's basic PR strategy amounted to: spread counter-narrative and misinformation, discredit and silence the opposition, leverage official channels in any way that might increase public perception of legitimacy. In following her usual MO of ""you can be most effective by being more ruthless than anyone expects,"" dev took out an infamously broken type of court order to serve as a makeshift gag-order. The ""hearing"" for this order lasted maybe 10 minutes. Judge did not allow me to present evidence in my defense. Judge refused to hear the First Amendment objections. Judge did not even give me an opportunity to speak. My attorney was upset enough by the whole thing that he took the initiative of compiling the record and docketing the appeal pro-bono. 
8. It is unclear whether dev was aware of the increasing concern among legal scholars for this sort of order to be used in violation of the First Amendment. 
9. The appeal application sat on a shelf at the lower court for a few months, presumably to ripen. In the meantime, dev was trying very hard to land me in jail for basically anything dev could make a case for. At one point, dev filed a complaint for my tweeting ""#GamerGate owes me a drink."" All claims from this ~5 month period refered to #GamerGate as a hate mob. No claims noted the variety of charitable causes (from anti-bullying to suicide-prevention to food drives) it has donated upwards of $90k to. Rude. 
10. Most of dev's violation claims did not make it past the clerk. Three did. A prosecutor was assigned to these violation claims.
11. My attorney and I notified the prosecutor that we were appealing the underlying order. The prosecutor agreed to hold off on prosecuting until the appellate court had decided on whether or not the order should, under any legal interpretation, have been granted in the first place.
12. Appeal application continued to ripen until, at some pint in April, it was finally docketed. 
13. I was all like ""Guys, I'mma write the brief.""
14. You guys were all like ""It's dangerous to go alone. Take this."" And gave me a bunch of money to hire an appellate attorney.
15. I hired an appellate attorney. Oh, and also someone told me to email law professor and superhero Eugene Volokh, who said he would help out and write an amicus brief for free(dom of speech).
16. Dev heard tales of the appeal, and was not pleased. Dev attempted to take out a duplicate order out-of-state, presumably as a fallback in case I won the appeal in *my* state. 
17. Volokh referred me to an attorney who agreed to take on the case for that new order literally over the weekend and on a pay-what-you-can basis. That attorney did an excellent job, and I hope to pay him back in full some day [currently half way there]. Anyway, we won.
18. This left dev with no fallback, and a risk of losing some narrative points if the appellate court ruled in my favor. This simply would not do. 
19. Dev hired Giant Legal Conglomerate Wilmer Hale, who assigned four(?) attorneys to dev's case.
20. We filed for Direct Appellate Review hoping the state Supreme Court would fast-track the case into their purview based on the constitutional questions posed. We then filed our appellate brief with the appellate court.

 21) Wilmer Hale told the MA Supreme Court ""There's no need to get involved here. We're vacating the underlying order. It's cool.""  
 
 22) Wilmer Hale vacated the underlying order, and filed a response brief with the Mass Appellate Court essentially arguing ""Oh god pleeease look the other way on this. We've vacated the order, rule the case moot. Official scrutiny does not serve our client's ~~PR~~ best interests.""  

 23) The Supreme Court said ""we'll let the appellate courts do their thing before we get involved.""  

 24) We filed a reply brief with the appellate court to the effect ""it's not moot because the order can still be reissued at any time, and only an opinion from this court could prevent that. And also there are still the existing violation claims pending.""  The appellate courts pondered.  
 


-----------

So, [last we left off](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3qtq5j/happenings_eron_here_with_an_update_and_legal_ama/), the Supreme Court said ""go through the appellate court."" Wilmer Hale argued that the case should be ruled moot because the underlying order was vacated. We argued that this doesn't offer sufficient protection in the future, nor does it resolve the matter of the pending violation claims.

Since then -- the violation claims have disappeared. The prosecutor was asked to drop them, and, as soon as the prosecutor agreed, Wilmer Hale filed a letter with the appellate court informing them that the violation charges had been dropped, so there was now almost no conceivable reason not to rule the case moot. 

We might consider that, because the plaintiff really really wants the appeals court to rule the case moot, the plaintiff (or perhaps Wilmer Hale) may, in a roundabout way, be admitting that the First Amendment really does exist. Given the information available thus far, we might even charitably interpret the plaintiff's request that the underlying order and all pending charges be dropped as something resembling a begrudging mea culpa.

Unfortunately, this is not a Holiday Special. Plaintiff didn't simply drop the underlying charges, but also requested the prosecutor replace them with a different charge. Mass General Laws chapter 265 section 43a. Criminal Harassment. Which is precisely another one of those small handful of laws that has first amendment scholars concerned about the potential for misuse as a First Amendment loophole.

Dropping the pending charges and replacing them with this new one has a pernicious effect. Even though the new charge is based on the same underlying claims, it's *technically* a different legal issue altogether. Which means, even if the appellate court were to rule that order was invalid, that ruling would (arguably) offer much less relief toward this new charge (depending on the wording, anyway). And since the appellate court's ruling would offer less relief, Wilmer Hale can use that forced change in circumstance to make a stronger argument in favor of mootness with one hand, while actively restricting my speech with the other (my speech would necessarily be ""chilled"" as the proceedings for this replacement charge are underway). The only way to get the appellate court to also chime in on this replacement charge would be to lose the new charge, then file yet another appeal (which would take yet another year or two).

If that all sounds a bit grim, it's not!  The Appellate Court has not only *not* ruled the case moot yet, but seems to have just signaled the opposite. **They've just scheduled oral argument** for some as of yet to be decided date between March 1st - 18th. They might hypothetically still rule the case moot after oral argument -- but the fact that they scheduled it all given the circumstances is quite encouraging. 

So, this is it. As far as moments of truth and things which might be important go -- like it or not, March is probably gonna be one of them. From a somewhat depressing/comedic perspective, it's ""important"" enough to someone that they hired Giant Legal Conglomerate Wilmer Hale to prevent it from happening. More seriously, and more broadly, it is important enough that it could lead to real and lasting change in at least some small pocket of the universe. 

Like, holy shit there is actually a chance that this sets legal precedent. 
I mean like, if you're into that, or whatever. 
No big deal.

[Anyway I've increased the Freeze Peach funding goal to account for attorney's estimated prep-time and oral argument + outstanding balance. I've also added the latest invoices for transparency.](http://162.243.138.46/funding/drive.php) If you wanna chip in -- know that the recent legal maneuvering leaves me with basically no clue what the odds are that we'll win -- but on my end at least, I'm gonna try.

In the meantime, thanks for everything so far. It's been nuts. I'll be around sporadically to make bad jokes or answer questions."

1899,"Hi KiA,

Some of you will have already heard of Gregory Alan Elliott. He's a 55-year old artist in Toronto who has been facing criminal charges of harassment for the past 3 years. His ""crime"" was challenging feminists on Twitter who wanted to lead an online witch-hunt against a video game developer. As a result of the allegations, activists have even gone as far as to vandalise his artwork in Toronto coffee sops. More details about his case can be found [here](http://www.freedomoftweets.ca/trial/)

The case is an appalling example of politically-motivated censorship. Much like the Gjoni case, if Elliott is convicted it will send out a chilling effect across social media. People will think twice about criticising feminists if they're worried they might be put on criminal trial. The damage already caused to Elliott's personal life and livelihood by this trial has already sent out a terrible message of intimidation. 

I think we should send out a different message: that the defenders of free speech on the internet can and will unravel the damage caused by authoritarians. That attempts to suppress speech and intimidate critics will only backfire. That's why I'm helping co-ordinate the #FreedomOfTweets campaign, which aims to raise money for Gregory's legal fund, and repair some of the damage to his reputation by getting the true story out there.

I hope you guys will join me. I know people shill here all the time, but I truly believe this case is one of the biggest battles I know of for free speech on the web, and I don't want to let Elliott and his family lose.

Here are some of the things we have planned over the next few days and weeks.

**Livestreams:**
The first of these will be on Milo's YouTube channel this Saturday (21st). It'll start at 9AM PST and end approximately 6 hours later. Guests include Sargon of Akkad, Cassie Jaye, Gavin McInnes, and Tim Moen, the leader of the Canadian Libertarian Party. [More details can be found here.](http://www.freedomoftweets.ca/updates/2015/11/19/freedomoftweets-livestream-saturday-21st-november-9am-pst)

**Social Media:**
I've scheduled a [Thunderclap](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/34860-freedomoftweets-the-gregory) to promote Gregory's legal fund. I ask that you all join me on the hashtag on the day of the livestream and over the next few days to promote the campaign. If you can't donate, sharing links and messages on social media is the next best thing <3

**Media:**
I've sent out a press release to all major journalists in Canada with news of the campaign's launch, and also to a number of friendly libertarian journalists. I'm hoping to get as much coverage as possible. Once again, sharing links to these articles if and when they come out is really helpful.

My number one priority over the next few weeks is making sure Gregory's [fundraising campaign](https://www.generosity.com/fundraisers/gregory-alan-elliott-twitter-trial-support-fund) gets off the ground. It's important to send a message that censorship will backfire, and that victims will always gain far more support than they lose as the result of such efforts. That's how to beat cultural authoritarians.

I hope you agree, and I hope you'll join me over the next few days :)


**UPDATE 1**
We've reached 100% of our Thunderclap target! Thank you everyone! Saturday is going to be great.

1906,"Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, is the new bete noire of the professional liars. Ever since he proposed a mechanism for holding dishonest journalists accountable, they have gone after him. He was attacked as Trump-like figure and compared to Gamergate  (even though they simultaneously claim that Gamergate has nothing to do with holding dishonest journalists accountable), and when he pointed out that the media doesn't really hold powerful people to account because it is owned by powerful people, they dishonestly twisted that into something anti-Semitic. 

**TL;DR:** https://imgur.com/a/8DsaM7m - https://i.imgur.com/5btGp5o.png

Then they pulled the gender card. The professional victim Erin Biba, who poses as a science writer, attacked Elon Musk and then whined about getting pushback from his 'fans', 'Musk Bros' (more likely: people who were appalled by her extreme dishonesty). The smear piece she wrote for the Daily Beast was praised by the editor-in-chief Noah Schachtman. 

Musk was having none of it. [This man doesn't yield and apologize](https://imgur.com/a/8DsaM7m), he gets even. Schachtman was comprehensively destroyed. Musk pointed out that he is extremely dishonest, and he punctured this guy's ""harassment of wamen"" narrative (i.e., the Gamergate playbook). 

> ""Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I'm against science is like saying Beyonce doesn't know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue.""

Schachtman is a particularly annoying douchebag who starts every tweet addressed to Musk as ""Elon,"" as if Musk is on a first name basis with this useless clown. 

> This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite!

Schachtman also owned himself by saying this: 

> Also, you aren't really comparing your situations, are you? One of you is a celebrity billionaire who endured some mild ribbing for launching a car into space. The other is a freelancer who is being called a bitch and a c*nt by tens of thousands of the billionaire's fans. (2/2)

Did you get that? It's par for the course that he lied about tens of thousands of people calling the dishonest Erin Biba a ""cunt"", but apparently, a few anonymous trolls using genitalia language is worse than a 'reporter' doing it. They hold themselves to lower standards than trolls whose raison d'etre is literally getting a rise out of people.

It's also worth noting that these are defined as Musk's ""fans"". Well, I am no fan of Musk, at least I wasn't... but seeing him destroy and humiliate you makes me like him. How on earth can you not like someone like that? These people don't necessarily love Musk, they hate you and your extreme dishonesty.

**Second useless idiot shows up**

[A second guy showed up to take punishment, by the name of Kevin M. Gill.](https://i.imgur.com/5btGp5o.png) He linked to the dishonest Erin Biba piece, and he added that he was the 'artist' who made the Mars paintings. Wow, you are IMPORTANT! So important that you had to remind Musk who you are. He ludicrously claimed that Erin Biba counts as ""good people"".

Instead of apologizing, or accepting the premises that this guy was offering, Musk challenged the narrative straight on. He pointed out that Erin Biba is not a good person in any sense of the word, [due to her history of ad hominems and unprofessional conduct.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/8n0jkz/twitter_bullshit_richard_lewis_posted_evidence/)

Her views were mainly political, so they are not appropriate to discuss here, so my intent is to focus on the journalistic malfeasance involved here. Please do not link to the article in question either. All quotes here are from the article and appropriately censored, unless otherwise stated.

So yesterday, a Huffington Post 'journalist' named Luke O'Brien posted a new... *investigative* article in which he targeted an anonymous Twitter user and private citizen whose opinions he did not like. It was done with such glee that anyone is bound to be appalled by it:

> ----- anonymously spread hate online for years. She can’t hide anymore.

The information was also gathered in rather despicable ways. For example, her cousin was missing and she tried to get people to help her find that person. 

> And in July 2014, she posted a request for help in locating her cousin, who had gone missing in ----------. In local news stories about the missing woman, [real name] was quoted under her real name. Anyone paying attention to [Twitter username] would have made the connection to “[real name].”

Not only has she been targeted, but also her family members.

> --------, who declined multiple requests from HuffPost to comment, has managed to keep almost all of her personal information off the internet. The 45-year-old resident ------------, ---------, grew up in a Jewish family in ---------, ------------- a fairly affluent community not far south of New York City. Her father owns a wholesale business called ----------- that sells magnets, keychains and assorted gimcrackery. Her brother runs a popular restaurant and craft beer bar in ----- that also bears the family name.

Just to give you some of the flavor of the article:

> In 2014, she also started using neo-Nazi terms like “cultural Marxism”

Damn those Jews and their propensity to become Nazis, and perhaps even post Nazi propaganda like ""it's OK to be Jewish""! Another thing that was mentioned:

> who has used anti-Semitism for political gain by casting the Hungarian-American Jewish billionaire George Soros as an evil, globalist puppet master. [Real name] did the same on Twitter, often using clips from the Kremlin-controlled Russia Today to attack Soros:

It was alleged that the true reason for Roseanne Barr being canceled was her attack on Soros, which I didn't find credible in that case. Now I'm not one for conspiracy theories, but it's certainly interesting that the very next day, another user who was critical of Soros is smeared (and in this case doxxed).

> [Real name] also swooned over racist figures such as former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopolous

Repeat a lie often enough, and it will become the truth. In this case, a gay Jew who is married to a black guy is simply labeled as a racist without evidence.

> She tweeted obsessively, sometimes not even looking up from her phone or her laptop when people spoke to her, according to residents of her apartment complex. The rest of her time she seemed to spend eating vegan food at local restaurants, exercising at Planet Fitness

Shame on her for culturally appropriating SJWs.

They targeted her husband, who has now been fired:

> [Real name] appeared to operate without fear of fallout anywhere. As this story neared publication, she kept tweeting hate, even when her husband’s job was in jeopardy. Last Friday, after HuffPost asked the [company employing her husband] a second time if anyone there had known about [Twitter username] before hiring [her husband], the company responded definitively.
>
>
> “No,” said the [company] spokesperson. “Now that it has come to our attention, [husband] is no longer an employee.”

He expressed disappointment that destroying her husband has not made her stop voicing her views online. In a paragraph, he expressed the things she has posted since her husband was fired. And then:

> Clearly, [real name] wasn’t going to stop.
>
>
> (...) But that wasn’t the end for [real name]. She posted a long thread on Twitter blaming me for the [company]’s decision to fire [husband] over her bigotry. Within minutes, her followers began calling me with threats.

You saw that right, this guy is actually playing the victim after trying to destroy the lives of a woman - and her husband to boot, because he didn't like her opinions.

The media says: ""We hold the powerful accountable, and stand for the little guy.""  
In reality, it is: ""Nice life you got over there. Shame if someone were to try to destroy it.""

**Edit:** The faux victim act is working, at least in some quarters. Right Wing Watch's Jared Holt has written an article in which he permits O'Brien to play the victim and claim that those... opposing him doxxing someone are trying to silence others. Christopher Mathias (Huffington Post) also tweeted in support of the doxxing."
1913,"The thread states that Kotaku, RockPaperShotgun, and Polygon have not reported on Kingdom Come: Deliverance due to the developers pro-GG stance. This is misleading for a few reasons. First of all, it has only been a day. It's possible there will be posts about it later this week, or next week. Second of all, an alpha or beta release is no guarantee of coverage. For example, look at Wasteland 2. The Kickstarter for it had $3m in funding ($1m more than Kingdom Come) and its beta came out Dec 11, 2013. Now a beta is generally an even more polished game than an alpha...

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2/posts?page=4

1915,"We often hear about 'rape culture'. We often hear about 'male violence', usually when a professional victim has her extremist opinion challenged by someone (which is cyberviolence against women and girls). 

But what happens if there is actual violence against a woman or a girl? Well, we have seen in Cologne and Rotherham how these people react when actual sexual assault and rape takes place, so let's now take a look at how Social Justice Warriors react when small children are abused. 

> A Quebec aboriginal man who repeatedly burned a five-year-old girl with a cigarette, leaving permanent scars on her face, arms, legs and genitalia, has been given a lenient sentence after a judge determined he is a “collateral victim” of residential school abuse.

The issue is 'residential schooling', which was a controversial way Canada attempted to integrate Indians into mainstream society. You might . But it gets worse. He never attended these 'residential schools'. Who did? Did his parents? No. *His grandparents*. Because his grandparents attended residential schooling, this scumbag judge named Guy Lambert reduced his sentence for abusing a 5-year-old girl.

> Crown prosecutor Éric Thériault sought a four-year prison term on the grounds that serious crimes against children have to be forcefully denounced. He noted that the 2011 assaults caused 27 third-degree burns — 25 from a cigarette and two from a lighter. The victim, who cannot be identified, was left to suffer without medical treatment.
>
>
> Bellemare, who was 21 at the time of the assaults, is too young to have attended a residential school, as are his parents. But he grew up in an abusive household that the court heard was a legacy of residential school abuse suffered by his grandparents.
>
>
> The judge said Bellemare is among the “collateral victims of residential schools and of the cultural **genocide** that the Atikamekws of Wemotaci experienced.”
>
>
> He agreed that the violence inflicted by Bellemare was “serious, revolting and must be denounced to protect other children who are victims of violence.” But he concluded that the four years sought by the Crown was excessive in light of the accused’s aboriginal heritage.
>
>
> “The court imposes a less severe sentence on Mr. Bellemare considering the **consequences experienced by the community because of residential schools and the aboriginal reality,**” Lambert ruled.

The judge is not the only one to blame, even though he obviously acted like a complete idiot. In 1996, Social Justice Warriors passed a law trying to ensure that the 'representation' of Indians would be the same as that of the rest of the population. The problem is not that people commit crimes at a disproportionate rate, the problem is that when they do, they go to prison. We cannot have that.

> A 1996 change to the Criminal Code, aimed at correcting an over-representation of aboriginal convicts in prisons, directed judges to take into account the “circumstances of aboriginal offenders” when sentencing.

On the victim:

> A pediatrician testified that the scars were clearly caused by a cigarette and a lighter and that they would never disappear. The trial heard testimony from the victim identifying Bellemare as the attacker.
>
>
> The girl said she “screamed and cried, because it hurt,” Lambert noted in his ruling finding Bellemare guilty. “She does not know in how many places the accused touched her with his cigarette.”

Good job, you psychopathic, virtue-signaling, horrible excuse for a 'judge'.

Where are the feminists? Where are the Social Justice Warriors? Exactly where they were when Cologne and Rotherham broke: sticking their head in the sand, *or* defending these actions. This is your country under Social Justice: tweets expressing disagreement are 'violence', but people who actually assault and rape women are defended, because they happen to belong to a race these SJWs do not despise."

I'll lay out some of the stuff in it so you can see how crazy this is.

The law creates a parallel justice system that will be controlled by LGBT groups and will not have to respond to normal tribunals. In fact, they can continue a process and fine people even if a normal tribunal deems that you're innocent.

This new system will reverse the burden of proof; if you're accused of ""discrimination"" , or of saying something ""offensive"" against someone lgbt, you'll have to prove you're innocent. If you're deemed guilty, you can be fined for even 45.000€ (i guess that would be more than 50.000$), but not only that, they can suspend your activities or close your company for up to 2 years. And of course, what is ""offensive"" is not defined, but instead it says the LGBT groups will decide what is offensive.

This means that they can fine someone they deem ""offensive"" and close their company if they can't prove they're inocent, without having to pass through a tribunal.

The law also apply to comments made in social media, or even in private, and even contemplates funny images as ""offensive"". Yes, they can fine you for posting memes, even if you send them by whatsapp to a group of friends. The law even say that having a neutral attitude can be considered discriminatory or offensive. In essence, you can be fined for fucking everything.

They even proposed that books or websites that are considered ""offensive"" would be destroyed. Yes, they literally want to burn ""offensive"" books by law.

This law is madness. It can be abused on an even higher level than our gender violence law. It gives an insane ammount of power to extremelly biased groups that consider practically anything to be an offense, and strips citizens of the most basic rights in favor of a minority. And these are the same people that spend their days saying that Spain is full of fascists. Yeah, it seem it is, but they have to look into a mirror to find them.

Edit: I forgot one important thing; with this law, 12yrs old will be able to start hormonal treatment without their parents consent. I'm in favour of anyone who wants to change sex, but injecting hormones to little kids who have no developed brain nor experience to know what they even are or want is pure madness, and with this law they'll not need consent from adults for it."

> Reuters asked the experts which five of the 193 United Nations member states they felt were ""most dangerous for women and which country was worst in terms of healthcare, economic resources, cultural or traditional practices, sexual violence and harassment, non-sexual violence and human trafficking,"" according to Reuters own article on the survey.

There does not seem to be any way of finding out who these 550 people are. I think I know who they are, the same people who run ""Women's Studies"" departments.

It gets worse. [On the website, you can get a more specific ranking depending on the issue.](http://poll2018.trust.org/) Looking at 'sexual violence', the US ranks:

1. India
2. Democratic Republic of the Congo
3. Syria
3. USA
5. Congo [sic]
6. South Africa
7. Afghanistan
7. Pakistan
9. Mexico
10. Nigeria
10. Egypt
10. Somalia

Reddit messes up the rankings, but both the US and Syria have a '3'. American women are just as much at risk of rape as women in a war zone, where rape has been used (1) as a weapon of war and (2) as a means of humiliating 'infidel women' who have been captured. Syria has literal slave markets for sex slaves. That is what ""Women's Rights experts"" equate America to. 

The other countries, which the 'experts' think are better than America on the issue of rape, are also trainwrecks. And South Africa is where babies get raped because of false superstitions about sex with babies curing AIDS. Nigeria, where the leader of Boko Haram brags about selling women as (sex) slaves, is ranked 10th. 

In other greats, the USA is ranked worse than Saudi Arabia when it comes to 'non-sexual violence', even though beating your wife is legal in that country, and the 'experts' seem to have a consistent axe to grind with India - which they rank worse than Pakistan on (nearly) all issues. I am pretty sure India isn't worse than the Congo on the issue of rape either.

These are *experts*. We better listen to them. They know what they're talking about. They're totally not overprivileged, middle-class women who obsess over their own non-problems ('manspalining', 'himpathy', and a scientist's shirt) while ignoring the desperate plight of women elsewhere in the world."

I've never said or done anything even remotely offensive towards any of these groups. I've always treated all humans as equals, no matter their religion, race or gender.

Yet, when movies like The Red Pill, which showcases some of the problems that men face in our society, feminists boycott it so I can't see it.

Netflix makes a series called ""Dear White People"", and MTV has made several similar videos as well, telling me what I should and shouldn't do.

Buzzfeed has made several statements and videos telling me what I should and shouldn't do, like manspreading.

I asked my girlfriend what she thinks about this and she says MTV and Buzzfeed are completely insane, that I have always treated her and everyone around me with respect and common courtesy.

Yet feminists and SJWs continue to run campaigns against my skin color and my gender.

When I was born, there was no segregation anymore since a long time already. I see people of colour everywhere, I see women in my office, even working higher positions than me. I see people of various ethnicities having more money than me or even the average white person. I see women, gays and trans people in public getting basically no special attention - being treated completely equal.

I've never even seen racism, sexism or homophobia in real life. Everyone in my circle of friends and family has the same attitude as me. They condemn people who are racist or sexist.

But now, I feel attacked by these third wave activists. They call me out for my skin color, lay out opressive rules for my gender, it's discrimination. I read about white people not being allowed in ""multicultural"" groups and events. I see people talking about ""inclusivity"", but not for men.

I'm sure there are enough sane people (or enough people who don't even notice this is going on) to avoid another race and/or gender segregation like we had 50 years ago, but I notice it. And so do at least 80.000 other people on this sub.

Aren't people supposed to learn from their mistakes and *fight* segregation, racism and sexism? So why is it being turned around now for revenge? Are people really that dumb? This is not about equality anymore. It makes me sick.

1952,"I got contacted by my great grandmother recently that she wanted to talk. She asked a lot about what I was doing. She had briefly heard about my activities lately from my aunt and she wondered if I would be game to translate something she wanted to say to everyone here. The following is her letter to us:

""Dear People of Reddit,

Thank you for taking care of my great grandson with his interests. I would like to relate a story to you. 

When I was young, a very, very long time ago, Japan was brilliant. There were so many new wonderful things coming in from overseas and so many wonderful ways Japanese things were being reinvented and modernized for the modern age. 

My favorite was a series of books that were like recipes. They had all sorts of Chinese and Western food in them. My imagination was set on fire just thinking about what they tasted like. I remember the day a new shop opened in our town and one of the items from the books that I had always wanted to taste was in the menu. It was an omelet made of rice and vegetables. I remember thinking it was heaven to taste and so different from anything I had ever eaten. It was a kind of combination of Japanese food and Western food. Back then that was a new thing.

That image of succulent eggs, rice and vegetables years later during the war saved me. Books like that were not allowed to be distributed anymore. English and Western terms had been re-imagined into horrible Japanese terms that didn't fit and their natural pronunciations were outlawed, so that one had to use Chinese characters for every term. It was there to assert the ridiculous concept that all that was around us had been created by us Japanese. 

Our family is a family of writers and my father, whom I was very angry with at the time, but now I understand, had died saying that, 'It is more honorable to die with the truth than to live to spread lies.' I could not understand why my father would not just write what they told him to write back then. I was so angry that he left us behind. 

I worked tirelessly every day in a factory that produced munitions for troops and I had no choice but to comply. To this day, my hands are warped from the experience. Back then all I understood was that all the color and vibrancy of things had been sucked out of the world around me. I dared not think of the freer days of my childhood because everybody told me it was a lie. 

I can remember it very clearly. I had trouble thinking back then. Censorship will do that to you. At first, they are such trivial thoughts that you think, 'Surely, I can bend just to this. It's only polite.'  You don't notice that the thoughts aren't coming as clearly as they used to, that they are being blocked by a certain mystical something you can't clearly see. 

Then it becomes harder to remember the facts and the principles you know are true. Things like that people from different places can cooperate. That there is not a group of white imperialists trying to oppress all of Asia and that if we don't fight them we will be slaves to them, and if they ever arrive on Japanese shores that all their men will rape us. That the very notion is silly. Eventually, it gets so difficult to think that you might give in just to stop fighting and get along with what everyone else is saying. 

In a corner of my mind, I would not give up. I had tasted omelet rice. I knew the idea could not have come solely from Japan. I remembered the word, even though it was forbidden. That was it, the memory that proved to me what I knew was true.

I had always wanted to start a restaurant of my own and have food from all over the world, healthy food that made for strong people. I did not know it back then, but what I was interested in was the burgeoning fields of nutrition that had been brought from overseas. By the time the war ended and Japan began to walk a better path again, it was too late. My opportunities were gone. I would be grateful for just a refrigerator for my growing family. Many people told me that my interest in food was simply a passing fad and that I should not be so stubborn about such a silly, small thing.

But now as I look back and I see that many of my friends from that period have died, many of them have died bitterly. They never seemed to recover from mind censorship, never seemed to go back to being as vibrant thinkers as I knew them to be. They kept fitting into what they were told to fit into.

I know what kept me sane was the image of omelet rice. I know that sounds silly, but it is true. Those 'silly' books I was told were just children's fairy tales and not of any real importance. But those were the last links to reality I had when everything else had been cut off. I am so glad I held onto them. People will tell you that you should not worry if silly things are censored, but censorship is a jail for the mind, and the more of it you jail, even the silly things, the less the mind can travel freely. I eventually began to recover from it because I believed in a silly thing like my memory of how omelet rice tasted. 

Many old people my age will tell you that your interests like phones and games and videos are just silly and you shouldn't get worked up about them. But I think you should. I do not like the way people act these days about what we ought and ought not to say. About words that should not be allowed or how hobbies are bad and must be censored. It reminds me too much of my father who drank himself to death after being forced to say too many words that were not his own. 

I hope the same thing never happens again for anyone in any country, but if it does, the thing that you hold on to is the 'silly' things that you fight for because those are the things you have an attachment to. We hope they do not, but people do change. Your memories of lovely things will not. They will always be there to anchor your reality and some people will want to say you're imagining things, but I assure you, you are not. 

A wise woman named Miyuki Nakajima once wrote, 'Fight! Those who will not fight will probably laugh at the songs of those who fight.' Well, isn't it nice that they can laugh and you can fight?

Sincerely,

An old, dried up hag who loves her omelet rice""

Well, there you are. "

You subscribe to subs you find interesting or want to participate in, not subs you disagree with and are too afraid to post in. You don't see me subscribing to a bunch of SJW subs and whining about how the people there don't like me and make me feel unwanted. So take your ""vocal minority"" lie and shove it up your ass. You want to destroy this sub, because you disagree with the MAJORITY here, YOU are the vocal minority. But guess what, that's not how democracy works and if you have any decency left, you're gonna give up your mod powers instead of abusing them and pretending you're some sort of freedom fighter for the oppressed masses."

We should respect his requirement for distance, otherwise it's not worse than the ""oh you believe in equality? You're a feminist then!"" bullshit.

EDIT: There's a lot of comments saying he's pro because he's previously said so. Things have obviously changed somewhat since then, and he's said multiple times he doesn't agree with labels/two narratives talking past each other etc.  I think it's fair to say he's supporting our goals regardless, and that should be enough.

EDIT2: Some need to chill out and realise I'm not ascribing 'proGG' as a dirty label. I'm trying to cut the guy some slack from having a target on his back for Ghazi/anti-GG psychopaths."

No just kidding it was a black female that was participating in the rally and was the President of the Pan African Student Union. http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2015/12/arrest_made_in_kean_twitter_threat.html. I'm willing to bet leftists and anti-gg use this tactic far more often then we even realize.

/r/gore is a very active subreddit and is highly similar to /r/WTF, an extemely popular subreddit, seemingly been left alone.

**Not only are they this similar yet one remains active, /r/gore had a NSFW warning before entering while /r/WTF does not**

Other subreddits quarantined recently include /r/spacedicks and /r/SwedenYes

along with various racist subreddits, some of which were joke subreddits like /r/blackfathers, the joke being no-one was able to post there.

For a full list go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/3fx89o/quarantined_subreddits/)

/r/watchpeopledie, another very active sub has been banned in Germany and is likely on the list to be quarantined judging from the recent actions.

This has all gone unnoticed outside of subreddits that actively point out these actions like this and /r/undelete, this is because Reddit doesn't release announcements concerning these actions, they just do it without warning even to the mods in a lot of cases.

This quarantining is following bannings of places like /r/coontown and various other palces, despite us still not knowing what they did to deserve bans, /u/spez himself pointing out that [they wouldn't be banned previously](https://i.imgur.com/Af1VCsX.jpg)

Yet places like /r/GamerGhazi continues to break rules like [doxing](https://archive.is/XfZXO)

and /r/ShitRedditSays brigading.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT: This is what happens when a subreddit is quarantined for those confused:**


* Requiring an account with a verified email address
* Requiring an explicit opt-in
* No custom images
* Will generate no revenue, including ads or Reddit Gold

Not only this, the quarantine warning puts a huge amount of people off from entering it, even though there were NSFW warnings before hand."
